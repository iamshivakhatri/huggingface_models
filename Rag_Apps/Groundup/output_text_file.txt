Praise for Storyworthy  and Matthew Dicks
“Offers countless tips, exercises, and exam ples to get you on your way to better stories. Anyone
who wants to take the stage, become a better writer , or simply tell better stories at Thanksgiving will
benefit from Storyworthy .”
— Jef f Vibes, filmmaker
“I laughed, gasped, took notes, and carried this book around like a dear friend — because that’s
exactly what a storyworthy book should be. As a novelist, I’ve studied my craft in countless ways,
but never before have I seen its marrow revealed with such honest, approachable charisma. Matthew
Dicks has written a perceptive companion for every person who has a story to tell — and don’t we
all?”
— Sarah McCoy , internationally and New Y ork T imes–bestselling author of Marilla of Gr een Gables
and The Baker ’s Daughter
“Matthew Dicks is a master storyteller and an incredible teacher . Most importantly , he is an artist
who paints his verbal canvases with moments that change how his listeners see the world. Matt
taught me about the hidden arc and architecture that lie behind every well-told story, and I’ve
incorporated his techniques into innumerable courtroom presentations — and told several stories
before live audiences — all thanks to Matt.”
— Ron Apter , trial lawyer
“When I gave Matthe w Dicks a recurring spot on my podcast, I billed him as ‘the most interesting
man in the world.’ He really has lived quite a life. But what’ s truly interesting is not necessarily
what he’ s experienced but how he makes you, the audience, experience it through him.”
— Mike Pesca,  NPR contributor and host of Slate  magazine’ s daily podcast, The Gist
“Learning from Matthew Dicks has truly been life changing both for me as a public storyteller and
for my high school students. Matt’ s practical advice and techniques can be applied immediately , and
that’s what Matt encourages and inspires you to do. Start crafting your best stories right now: learn a
little about yourself in the process and begin living a life of yes.”
— Jennifer Bonaldo,  English teacher , Amity High School, Bethany , Connecticut
“Matthew Dicks is not only a master storyteller; he is a master teacher . His clear and detailed
instructions allow him to brilliantly give his techniques and tricks of the storytelling trade to his
students. I personally benefited immense ly from Matt’ s workshop, and I continue to use his
techniques both in my professional work as a rabbi and teacher and onstage at Moth StorySLAMs.”
— Rabbi Ira Ebbin,  Congregation Ohav Sholom in Merrick, New Y ork, and Moth StorySLAM
winner
“I had the opportunity to take Matthew Dicks’ s workshop for beginners and then his advanced
workshop. They were truly life changing. From Matt’ s instructions, I have been able to sculpt true
stories that I have shared with an audience of five hundred people. I am not a professional
entertainer . But because of Matt’ s insightful direction, editing, and support, I now have the
confidence and ability to turn my life experiences into stories that entertain and impact many
people. Thank you, Matt. One doesn’ t always have the opportunity to live a dream.”
— Lee Pollock,  president, The Pollock Company , Hartford, Connecticut
“In Storyworthy , Matthew Dicks gives us all the tools we’ll need to become an effective storyteller ,
and he does so with wit, wisdom, and self-ef facing charm. What’ s more, he reminds us that through
storytelling — and our willingness to be honest and vulnerable when sharing the different moments
that have helped shape our lives — we invite the great possibility of deeper connection with others,
and with ourselves. This book serves as a guidebook and a muse, rooted in the belief that our
individual stories, when shared with heart, end up walking us down the pathway to true belonging.
Storyworthy  acts as a bright light along that journey .”
— Scott Stabile,  author of Big Love: The Power of Living with a W ide-Open Heart
“Matthew Dicks is dazzling as a storyteller and equally brilliant in his ability to deconstruct this
skill and make it accessible for others. His workshop was a veritable epiphany — it has been
formative in my own professional career and in helping shape the work of my students. Trust me:
whatever Matt has to say about storytelling, you want to hear. In my role at Yale, I oversee courses
that involve more than one hundred faculty  members. I can say without a doubt that Matt is one of
the finest teachers I’ve ever seen.”
— David A. Ross, MD, PhD,  director , Yale Psychiatry Residency T raining Program

About the Author
Foreword
In early 2000,  I got onstage, I told a story at this thing called The Moth,
and something in my heart and head felt better . I remember talking about
my biggest screwups, about some childhood dreams that hadn’ t come to
pass, and about how my attempts to pursue them at half-steam were clumsy
and ill-fated. The story I told that night, about going to Austin to become a
singer -songwriter and discovering the hard way that I wasn’ t prepared or
particularly good at songwriting, felt like the most deflating stuff any of us
go throu gh in personal defeats. Up to the moment I stepped onstage at The
Moth that night, my life felt as if the stain of failure had been on me since
about age twenty . But when I opened my mouth and shared a story about
the details of that trip to Austin, the crowd laughed. Which made me smile
through the bundle of nerves I was that night, and somehow made me feel
like maybe, just maybe, everything would be okay in this life.
If I can recomm end storytelling to you for any reason at all, it would be
that storytelling helps you realiz e that the biggest, scariest, most painful or
regretful things in your head get small and surmountable when you share
them with two, or three, or twenty, or three thousand people. The other
reason I can recommend storytelling, and learning about it with the book
you’re holding, is that we’re all disappearing — you, me, everyone we
know and love. A little heavy for a foreword maybe, but when you tell
stories, you do yourself a kind favor by taking a moment to write your name
in the wet cement of life before you head to whatever is next. This is a
much more selfless act than conventional wisdom would have you believe.
It’s a little like leaving a note in the logbook on the trail that others will be
hiking after you, a note that might give the next hiker a clue: “Keep your
eyes open for rattlesnakes by the bluff at the two-mile mark” or “There’ s
fresh water at the fire lookout if you’re running low” or “I live in the woods
now, and I don’t care if I never see an iPhone again after staring  at one for a
decade until my head was tortur ed, my eyes were ruined, and my heart was
broken.”
Telling stories about your life lets people know they’re not alone; and it
lets some of the people closest to you — like family and loved ones — see
your life apart from the context of family and without the kind of revisionist
hindsight we can sometimes fall into concerning the ones we love most.
Opening your mouth, getting out of your head, and your house, so you can
be fully engaged in your life and the lives of others for the night — that’s
what storytelling  is all about, if you ask me. Or maybe it’s just as my friend
Jesse Thorn joked: “Storytellin g. In case you’re not familiar with it, it’s
kind of like a less-funny stand-u p comedy .” That line cracked me up — in
some ways, it’s right on the money . Then weeks later, it oddly made me
realize why I love storytelling so much: at its best, it’s not out to razzle-
dazzle you at any cost. There’s no adversarial relationship with the
audience; they’re not people leaning back in their chairs, drinking their two-
drink minimum, signing an implicit contract that basically says “You better
make me laugh.” There is no volley of anger like I’ve seen in comedy
clubs; just a crowd of people who want to hear what you have to say and in
some cases might be stepping up to the mic right after you to share
something about themselves.
Sometimes it’s the funniest thing you’ve heard, and you’re rolling.
Other times someone is getting attacked by a shark. Or going to space. Or
sitting next to their crashed car and reevaluating their life. Or wondering
how they got caught up in a world of white-collar crime. Or just dealing
with an average Tuesday evening and trying to make sense of life like the
rest of us on the planet. How can you not walk out of that room a changed
person after feeling that connection?
In my early years of hosting The Moth StorySLAM, I never gave much
thought to the numbers the judges in the audience hold up to score each
storyteller . The scoring has always seemed in the spirit of fun, a device used
to get the audience involved and to add some friendly stakes to the show .
And early on, it never seemed to me that the storytellers were any more
concerned with the scores than would be, say, a few friends throwing darts
in a bar or playing poker for acorns on a camping trip. Even when we
weren’ t great onstage (and I’m also pointing the finger at myself here, as a
host who sometimes tries to tell a story in the top or middle of the show), it
was just part of the fun, because  we were all there for each other, laughing
or shrugging it off when a story went sideways on us. If nothing  else, when
I bombe d somet hing, I figured maybe I had been of service — hey, maybe
someone in the audience who was too nervous to put their name in the hat
and share a story heard me and thought, “What am I afraid of? I’m not
going to do any worse than that guy!”
At some point as the years started racing past, I noticed storytellers
caring about the scores; sometimes people would get angry if they didn’ t
get the score they thought they deserved. Storytelling was getting a lot of
press at this point — The Moth Podcast  was up to tens of millions of
downloads a year, and tons of other great new storytelling shows were
popping up around the country . And it was around this time that I started
noticing a different kind of people coming around — a more competitive
type of personality . I was vexed, frankly . It had always seemed like the most
humble, fun-lov ing thing in the world to me. I mean, even the name of it
never sounded cool: storytelling . How could you develop an ego or agenda
to become internet- or podcast-famous (actual things, swear to god)? It’s a
little like wanting to have the biggest house on the tiny-home scene.
It seemed like there was a phase when suddenly people who you could
tell were seasoned actors or comedians were there; it felt like they were just
there looking for a way to get another gig on their résumé, hanging around
just long enough to see if this was going to be the thing that got them on TV
somehow . Oh, no — the cool kids were coming around!
I felt I was deve loping a way of sussing out people who were  the real
deal and not just coming aroun d for a hot minute to use story telling as a
stepping-stone. That had to be right about when I met Matthew Dicks. And
here’ s the twist: not only could you tell he was the real deal, the kind of
person you wish ed was a family  friend back home, but he somehow made
me see that it was okay to want to work at getting better at this stuff. He’s
the person I would watch whenever I was lucky enough to be hosting a
show he was in. He taught me that trying to get better at storytelling also
meant trying to get better at being a friend, or a son, a boyfrien d, a brother ,
or just a better person. He’s a guy you can tell has been as heartbroken as
you or me or anyone else carrying a heart around on earth, but he manages
to set that aside, in the background and subtext of his stories.
It would be easy for a guy like Matthew Dicks to get onstage and tell an
emotionally overwrought story to manipulate listeners into feeling
something; oversharing and “emotion porn” are super -fast ways to get a
reaction from an audience in the heat of the moment, and they wear off just
as fast, leaving  a mental hang over in their wake. But Matthew Dicks
forgoes the aforementioned tricks and instead tells stories like the one about
trying to impress his mom by jumping his BMX bike off the roof of his
house growing up. And having it end miserably , but not without his sister
nailing her cue of turning to their mother , as instructed by Matt, and
exclaiming a then-popular TV show’ s catchphrase: “That’ s incredible!”
This story is a perfect exampl e of how Matt somehow gets you to feel
bigger emotional stakes in subtext instead of hitting you over the head with
them.
Matthew came along at a time when the New York storytellin g scene
needed someone to remind it that storytellers are, first and foremost, a
family , no matte r how large, no matter how many different shows exist, no
matter in how many different cities or countries. The family might be
millions of people all over the world at this point, but Matthew Dicks is the
guy who makes you realize it was that big all along. That those of us
performing on this so-called storytelling scene haven’ t been doing anything
new at all, just stepping up to a mic to partake in something that’s been
happening since the dawn of time.
This book is the helping hand they didn’ t have in the caves of Altamira.
I mean, in fairness, they didn’ t need it back then — they seeme d to do just
fine at telling stories. But the world has changed a bit over the past thirty-
five thousand years, and the book you’re holding is a great resource. I’ve
always said that a good storytell ing show feels like a cross between therapy ,
rehab, and hangi ng out after dinner with friends. The idea of reading a book
to get better at telling stories might seem a little academic, but you’re about
to find out that this is a book written by someone with a great heart, who
believes you’ve got a great life full of stories in you and ahead of you.
I have to admit I have a soft spot for the way Matt fell into storytelling
— that he went to a Moth Story SLAM to make good on a promise, secretly
hoping deep down that his name wouldn’ t get called. And once he was in
that room  with everybody , he stuck around, but it’s almost as if he didn’ t
quite know what good could possibly come from it. Matthew Dicks hasn’ t
so much written a book about storytelling technique, or angling to get ahead
in the smallest waters of the entertainment scene, or marshaling the will and
ego to elbow your way past folks. He’s written a book about you and how it
would be great to have you hanging out and telling stories with everyone.
Even if you don’ t quite know what good could possibly come from it.
— Dan Kennedy , host of The Moth Podcast
PREFACE
A Coward Tells a Story
It’s July 12, 2011. I’m sitting in the Nuyorican Poets Café in downtown
Manhattan on a Monday night, though the buzz in the room makes it feel
like a Saturday . It’s hot and crow ded. A possible firetrap. The smell of stale
beer lingers in the air. Hipster is piled upon hipster , sitting in metal folding
chairs, standing at the rear of the club, and crowded around small, wobbly
tables. A spotlight is trained on a small stage peppered with Igloo coolers,
black electrical cords, and audio equipment. A single microphone stands at
center stage under the spotlight’ s warm glow .
Dan Kennedy — a man I’ve never met but whose voice I know from his
audiobooks and The Moth Podcast  — is standing onstage, hosting the show .
Dan is lean, with a wry smile and dark hair. He’s in his midthirties.
Relaxed. Confident. Everything that I imagined from listening to his voice
so many times. Plus, he’s funny. Effortlessly funny . Also sweet. Within
minutes, he’ s wormed his way into my heart.
This is my first time attending a Moth StorySLAM. The first time I plan
to take the stage  and bare my soul. Ten minutes ago, I dropped my name in
a canvas tote bag. Dan called it a hat, but I didn’ t dare quibble over
terminology . All I know is that from that proverbial hat, ten names will be
drawn to tell stories.
I’m praying that my name doesn’ t get picked.
After months of imagining this moment, the last thing I want to do now
is perform for this audience. I’m only here because I stupidly promised my
friends that I would someday tell a story at The Moth. Now all I want to do
is bolt. Either that or sit here silently for the rest of the night. I’d be willing
to remain silent the rest of my life if I could avoid going up on that stage.
Two years ago, my friend Kim recommended that I listen to The Moth’ s
weekly podcast. The Moth, an international storytelling organization,
produces shows  that feature true stories told live onstage without notes.
Experienced storytellers, terrified rookies like me, and the occasional
celebrity take the stage to share meaningful moments from their lives with
hundreds and sometimes thousa nds of people. Kim suspected that I’d enjoy
the stories featured on The Moth Podcast , and she was right.
Listening to The Moth’ s storytellers, I instantly fell in love with their
vulnerability , humor, and honesty . A Moth story offered me a rare glimpse
into an entirely new world. I was amazed by the instant connection I felt to
storytellers whom I could not see and did not know .
I didn’ t know it at the time, but even though storytelling seemed
mysterious and impossible, I was already immersed in the craft. Whether I
was delivering a talk about my latest novel or speaking to paren ts during an
open house or even flirting with my future wife, it turns out that I have been
telling stories for a long time.
More importantl y, I also had a natural affinity for sharing my less-than-
noble moments with others. I’ve always known that embarrassment could
get a laugh. Telling about my most shameful and foolish moments had
always brought me closer to listeners. Honesty is attractive. A friend of
mine once said that I “live out loud.” It describes me well.
Perhaps I first learned this lesson on the page. Having written a blog
since 2004, I’ve long understood the power of unbridled honestly and
unflinching vulnerability . I’ve managed to capture the attention of a sizable
audience by writing openly and truthfully about my life. I’ve established
friendships with people from around the world through the power of my
words. But this was new. Listening to a storyteller share a private story so
openly in front of an audience captivated me.
I eagerly  awaited Tuesday afternoons for the new episodes of The Moth
Podcast  to drop. I researched other storytelling podcasts and began listening
to them too. Consuming storie s in greater and greater numbe rs. I didn’ t
know it yet, but I had begun my education in storytelling.
Over the course of the next year, The Moth grew in popularity , and as it
did, more and more people began finding their podcast. Friends who’d
become fans of The Moth were soon calling me, telling me that I should go
to New Y ork and tell a story .
“You’ve led such a horrible life!” they’d say. “Your life has really
sucked. Y ou’d be great at storytelling.”
Although I wouldn’ t say that my life has sucked, they weren’ t entirely
wrong. To say my life has been colorful would be an understatement. The
short list of moments that my friends were referring to includes:
•Paramedics brought me back to life through CPR on two
separate occasions.
•I was arrested, jailed, and tried for a crime I did not commit.
•I was robbed at gunpoint. Handguns pressed against my head .
Triggers pulled.
•I lived with a family of Jehovah’ s Witnesses, sharing a smal l
room off their kitchen with a guy named Rick, who spoke in
tongues in his sleep, and with the family’ s indoor pet goat.
•I was the victim of a widespre ad, anonymous smear campaign
that included a thirty-seven-page packet of excerpted, highly
manipulated blog posts that was sent to the mayor , the town
council, the school board, and more than three hundred familie s
in the school district where I teach. This packet compared me to
the Virginia Tech killer and demanded that I be fired, along with
my wife (who was teaching with me at the time) and my
principal. If I wasn’ t fired, the authors of the letter warned us,
the packet would be sent to the press, and legal action would
commence.
•I discovered that I am a carrier of a gene that will ultimately lead
to a disease that killed my grandfather , my aunt, and my mother .
That’ s just the tip of the iceber g.
My friend Rachel recently told me about the time that her alarm
company called as she and her husband were driving home from Cape Cod.
“Your house might be on fire,” the representative from the alarm company
warned. “W e’re sending the fire department over right now just in case.”
Rachel and her husband, David, spent the next twenty minutes
wondering if their house was a smoldering pile of ash before finally pulling
onto their street and discovering it was a false alarm.
“Oh!” I said excitedly when she was finished telling her story . “That
reminds me of the time my house caught fire when I was a kid, and
firefighters pulled me from my bed while I was asleep!”
“Of course  that happened!” she said, rolling her eyes. “I have a story
about my house  possibly burning down, and you have a story about an
actual fire, complete with firefighters and a midnight rescue. Is there
anything that hasn’ t happened to you?”
It was a good point. I’ve led a dif ficult life in many regards.
So as more of my friends began finding The Moth Podcast  and listening
to the stories, more and more of them began reaching out, encouraging me
to go to New Y ork and tell a story for The Moth.
Tell the story about the time you went headfirst through the
windshield and died on the side of the r oad!
What about the time you accidentally flashed our sixth-grade math
class?
What about the time you called your dog back across the street into
the path of an oncoming truck?
Tell the story about the time you were hired as a stripper for a
bachelor ette party in the cr ew room of a McDonald’ s!
Weren’t you hypnotized onstage once and somehow ended up
completely naked in fr ont of the entir e audience?
“Yes!” I told my friends. “I’ll go to New Y ork and tell a story .”
They were excited. They were certain that I would succeed. They were
so enthusiastic that I couldn’ t help but get excited too. I was going to tell a
story for The Moth. I told everyone about my plan. I was going to take the
stage at a Moth StorySLAM in New York City and compete against the best
storytellers in the world. I was going to bare my soul just as I had heard so
many storytellers do on the podcast. I couldn’ t wait.
Then I didn’ t go.
Despite my excitement, I also knew the truth: I wasn’ t a story teller . I
didn’ t know the first thing abou t storytelling. I was a novelist.  I made my
living by inventing my characters and plots. I didn’ t tell true stories. I
wasn’ t burdened by annoying facts and inconvenient truths. My talent lay in
making up stuf f quietly in a room by myself.
Not only did I have no idea how to craft a true personal story , but I was
also terrified about performing  in front of hundreds of disaf fected New
York hipsters wearing organic  denim rompers and drinking Pabst Blue
Ribbon. They were the cool kids from high school who listened to
under ground indie bands and oozed irony . I was terrified. Thou gh I’d been
working as a wedding DJ for almost two decades and was more than
comfortable speaking to large audiences, I’d never actually performed  in
front of an audie nce before. No one had ever expected me to be entertaining
or funny or vulnerable or honest. I simply steered the party in the right
direction. Kept the best man sober and on his feet through his toast.
Introduced “Mr. and Mrs.” to their wedding guests for the very first time.
Coaxed overwrought aunts and exhausted coworkers onto the dance floor
for the Electric Slide. Mainly I spoke clearly and played music. I wasn’ t
prepared for the high-stakes world of storytelling.
So instead of heading to New York, I remained safely at home. I taught
my fifth graders, DJed my weddings, wrote my novels, and avoided The
Moth. I made excuses, which were really lies.
I’ll go over winter br eak.
I promise I’ll go once I finish my next novel.
Maybe I’ll give it a shot during my school’ s April vacation.
I’ll just wait until this school year ends.
I’ll go next year .
I became an excuse machine. The excuses became part of a playlist of
lies that was perpetually cued up in my head and fell instantly from my lips.
Each excuse was worse than the last. Each excuse made me feel worse than
the last. And it was getting hard to keep my excuses straight — which ones
I’d told to which group of friends.
Then I had an idea. Rather than performing for strangers in New York
City, I’d start my own storytelling organization in my hometown. I had no
idea what that might entail, but anything sounded better than New Y ork.
Yes, I decided that it would be easier to write a business plan,  explore
nonprofit status, negotiate contracts with venues, book storytellers, and
purchase sound and recording equipment than it would be to stand on a
stage in Manhat tan and tell a five-minute story . Better to launch  a company
so I could tell stories for friends and family than compete again st seasoned
professionals in front of complete strangers.
This was the solution. I would create an opportunity to tell stories in a
warm, safe, and accepting environment somewhere nearby . Maybe even
right around the corner from my home. Brilliant.
Then I didn’ t do that either . Just as I did with performing for The Moth,
I delayed. I made excuses. I assured my friends that I’d begin producing my
own storytelling show any day. I’d find the perfect venue and launch an
organization dedicated to story telling and modeled after The Moth. But
instead of doing that, I deflected their inquiries. Pushed back  time lines.
Made more and more excuses. Just like when I’d gone to New York to
perform, I was afraid.
My failure to follow through on my promises began eating away at me.
This was one of the only times in life when I’d said that I was going to do
something witho ut any real intention of doing it. Guilt and shame began to
weigh on me. I started to think of myself as a coward. Finally I couldn’ t
take it anymore.  I had to come clean. I had to do the thing I was afraid to
do.
In June of 2011, I told my wife, Elysha, that I needed to go to New York
and tell a story . I said that I wouldn’ t be able to live with myself if I didn’ t.
“One and done,”  I said over a dinner of chicken and rice. “I’ll check it off
the list and never look back.”
“Sounds good,” she said, far too nonchalantly for my taste. Elysha has
this consistent, annoying confid ence in my abilities. She assum es that I’m
capable of almost anything, which both undermines her appreciation for my
abject terror and sets expectations far too high for my liking.
“I’ll get tickets,” she said, thus spelling my doom.
This is how I find myself sitting at a wobbly table in a packed
performance space, praying that Dan Kennedy won’ t call my name. With
luck, I can return home and tell my friends that I tried like hell to tell a story
at The Moth. Bad luck got in my way, I’d explain. My name remained stuck
in the bag. This failed attempt at storytelling might buy me a year of
dignity . Maybe my friends would for get about my promise entirely .
Things are looki ng good for me. Name after name has been drawn from
the hat, which really is a tote bag, despite what Dan Kennedy continues to
say, and my name has yet to be called. Storytellers have taken the stage and
told their stories on the theme of “ego.” I’ve liked most of the stories too.
Overall the storytellers seemed to know what they were doing  and adored
the spotl ight, although not everything has gone perfectly for them. An older
man who called himself Uncle Frank told a story that referred to his penis.
When Dan Kennedy asked for scores from the three teams of judges, each
held up two white cards indicating the storyteller ’s score on a ten-point
scale (though it appeared to really be a 7.0–10-point scale, with tenths of a
point dif ferentiating stories).
Except that one of the teams ignored the 7.0–10 norm and gave Uncle
Frank a 5.0, a score so low that it didn’ t make any sense. His story wasn’ t
bad at all. I really enjoyed it. I flinched when the score was announced,
almost as if I’d been the one scored poorly . The score seemed harsh and
irrational. More  to the point, the scoring suddenly  seemed unpredictable
and terrifying. I didn’ t know Uncle Frank at the time, but already I wanted
to hug him.
“What’ s up with the score?” Dan Kennedy asked the judging team
who’d rated Uncle Frank the lowest. “You really think his story was that
bad?” Dan’ s quick defense of Uncle Frank reassured me.
“I heard  that guy tell a story last week,” one of the female judges yelled.
“He talked about his penis in that story too. I’m sick of his penis.”
The room burst into laughter and applause. Dan laughed. Even Frank
managed a smirk.
Instead of laugh ing, I tensed up. My story didn’ t refer to my penis, but I
had a few penis-related jokes about my last name. I wondered if these
references might not sit well with the judges either .
But it looks as though I need not worry . The night is nearly over. Nine
names have been drawn from the tote bag, and mine is still safely inside.
Just one to go, and I can escape this night unscathed.
Dan opens the final slip of paper and reads the name:
“Matthew Dicks.”
I freeze. I can’t believe he’s called my name. I was convinced that I was
in the clear. I’d already begun the mental drive on I-95 back to Connecticut
as the conquering hero. I was already preparing my tale of woe:
“I put my name in the tote bag at The Moth. Sadly , it wasn’ t drawn, but
still, mission accomplished. I tried, damn it, which is more than I can say
for a lot of people. I’ll try again someday , maybe.”
Now those dreams are dashed under the weight of having to walk
onstage and tell a story .
Then it occurs to me: No one in the club knows me. I’m a stranger in a
strange land. If I don’t move or say a word, Dan will eventually give up on
Matthew Dicks and call another name. This has already happened during
the first half of the show . A name was drawn, and the storytel ler failed to
materialize. Dan tossed the paper aside and drew another . I can do the same
thing. I can just sit still and remain silent.
That is exactly what I do. I don’t move. I don’t make a soun d. Then
Elysha’ s foot connects solidly with my shin. I look up.
“That’ s your name,” she says. “Move it.”
I’m trapped. I have to tell my story . My terrible wife is makin g me. I
rise and slowly make my way to the stage. I ascend the steps and find
myself standing beside Dan Kennedy . He shakes my hand and smiles,
acting as if this stage is no big deal. As if standing in front of a throng of
expectant New Yorkers is something we do every day. I’m a little
starstruck.
As Dan begins to step aside to allow me to approach the microphone,
Jenifer Hixon, the show’ s producer , calls out to Dan, reminding  him that he
hasn’ t recorded the scores for the previous storyteller yet.
Dan turns to me. “Sorry ,” he says. “Wait just a minute.” He motions for
me to step off the stage so he and Jenifer can record scores from the judges
on a lar ge paper chart.
Instead I remain onstage. I stumble over to the coolers along the wall
and sit. I don’t want to tell my story . I don’t want to compete. I don’t want
to be here at all. I want to go home and forget this stupid idea forever . But if
I’m going to tell my story to this room of storytelling connoisseurs and
judgmental New  Yorkers, I want to do well. I don’t want to look like a fool.
With this in mind, it occurs to me that spending a couple minutes onstage,
getting a sense of the space and lighting and the audience, might help.
So I stay. I soak in the scenery . The height of the stage. The angle of the
spotlight. The position of the audience and the microphone. I try to relax. I
try to make this space my home.
Jenifer records the scores from the prior storyteller . It’s time for me to
take the microphone and tell my story .
I hate this night. I despise every bit of it.
Then I begin speaking my first words into the microphone and fall
instantly in love. Alone on the stage, standing before a room packed with
strangers, I tell a story about learning to pole-vault in high school. I reveal
my secret desire for my teammate to fail, so I could look better than he did
in our teammate s’ eyes. I bare my soul to that room. I tell them about the
ugly truth that resided at the center of my seventeen-year -old heart. I make
them laugh. I make them cheer .
When I finish, I step off the stage and return to Elysha and our wobbly
table. I have no idea how I’ve done, but I know it felt great. I already want
to do it again.
Dan Kennedy asks the judges for their scores. When the final score is
announced, a woman sitting beside me leans over and says, “Y ou won!”
I look at the scoreboard. She’s right. I’ve won my first Moth
StorySLAM. I can’t believe it. I return to the stage for a bow. Jenifer
informs me that I’m automatically entered in the next GrandSLAM
championship. I have no idea what a GrandSLAM is or what she’s talking
about, but I smile and thank her . I shake Dan Kennedy’ s hand.
I can’ t believe it. The next day I write the following blog post:
Yester day was one of those days that I will never forget. Last night I
had the honor of telling a story at one of The Moth’ s StorySLAM s at
the Nuyo rican Poets Café in the Lower East Side. My goal was to
simply be chosen to tell my story, but at the end of the night, I was
fortunate enough to be named the winner of the StorySLAM.
I got home last night around 1:30, went to bed around 2:00,
woke up around 5:30 to play a round of golf, and I was still walking
on air. I know it sounds a little silly, but in the grand scheme of
things, the birth of my daughte r was probably the most important
day of my life. Next comes the marriage to my wife, and then the
sale of my first book, and then maybe this. Definitely this. It was that
big for me.
Perhaps I’ll tell more stories in the futur e, and The Moth will
become old hat for me. Maybe this day will recede into the past with
other forgettabl e memories. But on this day, at this momen t, I
couldn’ t be happier .
Little did I know how prescient those words would prove to be. Less than
six years later, I’d won thirty-four Moth StorySLAMs in fifty-three
attempts. Thirty-four wins is among the highest win totals in the two-
decade history of The Moth. I’m also a five-time GrandSLAM champion
(also one of the highest totals in Moth history).
Since that fateful night in 2011, I’ve told hundreds of stories in bars and
bookstores, synagogues and churches, and theaters large and small to
audiences rangin g from dozens to thousands. I’ve performed throughout the
United States and internationally , telling stories alongside other talented
storytellers and in my own one-person shows. My stories have appeared on
The Moth Radio  Hour  and their weekl y podcasts many times and have been
listened to by millions of people.
I began my storytelling career by listening to storytellers on The Moth
Podcast . Today people listen to my stories on that same podcast and on the
radio. I still can’ t believe it.
But remember this: I didn’ t go to school to become a storytell er, and I
didn’ t grow up in a family of storytellers. My parents were like the adults in
a Peanuts  television special. There was occasional mumbling from the other
room through a cloud of secondhand smoke, but little more. My family
didn’ t communi cate through story . We barely communicated at all. I grew
up in a broken home with a family that had little time or inclination to fill
our lives with conversation.
I didn’t dream of becoming a storyteller . As I’ve made clear , I only
started telling because my friends shamed me into giving it a try. In other
words, I’m not special. I was not groomed to be a storyteller from an early
age. Storytelling is not a part of my DNA.
If I can do this, you can too.
But my friends were wrong about one thing. They thought I would be a
good storyteller because I’ve led an unusual and challenging life. They
thought that my stories of homelessness and near-death experiences and
encounters with the law would make me a great performer .
In that regard, they were wrong. Terribly wrong. Fortunately for both
you and me.
You need not spend time in jail or crash through a windshield or have a
gun jammed against the side of your head to tell a great story . In fact the
simplest stories about the smallest moments in our lives are often the most
compelling.
We all have stories. You may not believe this yet, but you will. You just
need to know how to find them in your everyday life and then capture them
for future telling.
Let me show you how .

Finding Your Story
No one ever made a decision because of a number . They need a story .
— Daniel Kahneman
Writing myself into existence. I think that’s what I was trying to do. And it’s cool to
write a song and then have it come true.
— Ani DiFranco
It’s a human need to be told stories. The more we’re governed by idiots and have no
control over our destinies, the more we need to tell stories to each other about who we
are, why we are, where we come from, and what might be possible.
— Alan Rickman
CHAPTER ONE
My Promise to You
About a year ago,  a man in one of my workshops asked, “Why am I here?
I don’t want to stand on stages and tell stories. I don’t want to compete in
story slams. I’m not an entertainer . I don’ t get it.”
It was a good question, particularly because the man in question hadn’ t
chosen my workshop. His wife had asked him to attend.
He wasn’ t the first person to attend a workshop for this reason. “My
wife told me to take your workshop” is a surprisingly common reason given
by men sitting before me in workshops.
Perhaps you’re asking the same question. If you have no desire to stand
on a stage and bare your soul, why learn to find and tell great stories?
Not that long ago, I was asking  the same question. Two years into my
storytelling career , Elysha and I founded that Hartford-based storytelling
organization that I’d once talke d about with friends. We call it Speak Up.
Together we produce shows throughout New England to sellout audiences
numbering as high as five hundred people.
About a year into Speak Up’s existence, I started teaching storytelling
too. But as with my journey to becoming a storyteller , my career as a
teacher of storytelling began against my will. As our Speak Up audience
grew and people wanted to learn to tell stories, they began asking me to
teach them the craft.
I balked . I had no interest. But they were persistent. Many wanted to
take a stage and tell a story . Others saw storytelling as a poten tial asset in
their careers as attorneys, profes sors, salespeople, or therapists.  Still others
thought storytelling might help them to make friends and improve their
relationships. Buckling under the weight of their pressure, I announced that
I would teach one storytelling workshop.
One and done.
Ten peop le spent six evenings with me in a conference room at the local
library . I taught them everything  I knew about storytelling. I told stories and
explained my process for crafting them. I listened to their stories and
offered feedback.
As with storytelling itself, I quickly realized how much I enjoyed
teaching the craft. Deconstructin g the elements of a good story . Building a
curriculum around what I knew  and was still learning. Listenin g to stories
and helping to find ways to shape them better . Turning my students into the
kinds of people who can light up a room with a great story .
My “one and done” workshop has grown into something I do regularly
and with zeal today . I travel the world teaching the art and craft of
storytelling.
The people I teach are varied  and diverse. I teach perform ers and
would-be performers who want to become better storytellers. Some have
never taken the stage before, and others are grizzled veterans  looking to
improve their skills. Many of these former students have gone on to take the
stage at The Moth, Speak Up, and other storytelling shows. In August of
2016, one of my students beat me in a Moth GrandSLAM  competition for
the first time. I finished second, and she finished first. Perhaps I taught her a
little too well.
I teach attorneys, salespeople, and business leaders who want to
improve their presentation skills, sales pitches, and branding.
I teach novelis ts, essayists, screenwriters, television writers, poets,
archivists, and other creative sorts who want to refine their understanding of
story .
I teach professors, schoolteachers, ministers, priests, and rabbis who
want to improve  their lectures and sermons and hold the atten tion of their
audiences.
I teach storytelling to people who want to improve their dating skills. I
teach people who want to be more interesting at the dinner table. I teach
grandfathers who want their grandchildren to finally listen to them. I teach
students who want to tell better stories on their college applications. I teach
job applicants who are looking to improve their interview skills. I teach
people who want to learn more about themselves.
People have quit therapy and opted to participate in my storytelling
workshops inste ad. While I don’t endorse this decision, it’s apparently
working for them. Wives send their befuddled husbands to my workshops,
hoping that storytelling will spark something inside them. Later they tell me
how their husba nds have opened up like never before. One woman told me
that her husband has opened up “a little too much.”
People take my workshops again and again to discover more about
themselves and find ways to connect with other people throug h their own
personal narratives. A married couple once spent their anniversary
attending one of my all-day workshops because they knew it would be a
chance to laugh together and learn about each other . They brought
champagne.
I teach the children of Holocaust survivors who want to preserve the
stories of their parents and grandparents. I teach psychiatrists and
psychologists who want to help their patients reframe their lives through
story . I teach politicians, labor organizers, health-care advocates, and
educational reformers who need to change hearts and minds.
I promise that whatever you do, storytelling will help. While I am often
standing on a stage and perform ing, there are few things I do in life that
aren’ t aided by my ability to tell a story . Whether I’m teaching  the metric
system to my fifth graders, pitching Speak Up to a new venue, selling my
DJ servi ces to a prospective client, or making small talk at a professional
development seminar , storytelling helps me achieve my goals. Storytelling
makes me a better dinner companion. It compensates for my inability to hit
a golf ball accurately . It makes me far more palatable to my in-laws.
No matter who you are or what you do, storytelling can help you
achieve your goals. That is why you are reading this book. That is why that
man was sitting in my workshop that day .
In these pages, you will find lessons on finding, crafting, and telling
stories that will connect you to other people. Make them believe  in and trust
you. Com pel them to want to know more about you and the things you care
about.
You’ll find specific examples of well-told stories. Exercises designed to
locate meaningful, compelling stories in your life. Step-by-step instructions
for crafting those stories.
I hope to entertain as well. As much as I want you to learn to become a
storyteller , I can’t help but tell some stories along the way. In addition to
teaching you how to tell an effective, entertaining, and moving story , I hope
to give you a peek into my life as a storyteller . My plan is to pull back the
curtain and show you some of the highs and lows of my storyte lling career .
In short, I plan to tell you some stories.
I also want you to trust me. There’ s no codified curriculum when it
comes to storytelling. No universally accepted laws or rules, no canonical
absolutes. Storytelling is more  art than science. It’s an ancient form of
communication and entertainment that has been practiced since humans
first developed language, but the rise in the popularity of personal
storytelling is relatively new. There are no official schools of thought. No
hard-and-fast formulas.
But I tell my students this: If you apply my strategies and methods to
the craft, you will become a highly successful storyteller . Not every
storyteller agree s with my strategies, but every student who has followed
my instruction has become an ef fective, entertaining, successful storyteller .
My instruction works. You too can be a great storyteller . It’s time to
learn how .
CHAPTER TWO
What Is a Story? (and What Is the
Dinner Test?)
A couple years ago,  a woman asked  Elysha why she first fell in love with
me. Fortunately  I was standing right beside her when the question was
asked.
I waited  for Elysha to say something about my rugged good looks,
quick wit, or enchanting eyes.  “I thought it was this situation,” I said,
motioning up and down my body .
“It’s never been this situation ,” Elysha informed me.
Instead she told the woman that it was storytelling that first made her
fall for me. She told the story of the night when she and I went to Chili’ s for
dinner — our first meal alone — before our school’ s talent show .
Just so we’re clear: This was not a date. Maybe I wanted it to be a date,
but at that time, I thought Elysha was out of my league. I still think this
today . Please don’ t tell her .
Elysha and I were fellow teachers and slowly becoming friends , but we
were both involved with other people at the time. We were technically
unavailable. Also Chili’ s was one of the closest restaurants to our school.
My point: I didn’ t take Elysha on a first date to Chili’ s. I’m not that guy .
Okay?
Elysha explained to the woman that over the course of our dinner, she
had asked me some questions about myself. We’d known each other for a
couple years by then, but we didn’t know much about each other  personally .
When I’m asked a question, I tell a story , so I told some stories that night. I
was still more than seven years away from taking a stage and telling my
first official story , but even back then, I was always ready and willing to
share my life with others, warts and all.
Elysha told the woman, “That was the night I started falling for Matt.
Listening to his stories, I realize d that he wasn’ t like anyone I had ever met
before, and I knew I wanted to hear more. I liked the way he told a story .”
Beautiful, right? I found the perfect spouse through storytelling.
Right after the beauty of the moment washed over me, I quickly shifted
to annoyance. By then I had been performing onstage and teaching
storytelling for a few years. I had made a name for myself in the storytelling
world. I’d attracted interest from businesses, universities, nonprofits, and
performers. Knowing all this, why had she waited until now to inform me
that my storytelling had been the key to her heart?
I told her that the story about falling in love with me through
storytelling fit perfectly into my personal narrative and explained how
useful it could have been to me for the past couple years of teaching and
performing. “You’re telling me that I found the perfect wife through
storytelling! That’s like a baseb all player hitting a home run into the right-
field bleachers that’s caught by the woman he eventually marries. It’s
amazing! How could you keep this from me?”
“I’m not in the business of helping you construct your personal
narrative,” she said.
She’s lucky I love her. But you see my point, right? Even before I was
telling stories onstage and thinking of myself as a storyteller , the ability to
tell a good story was helping me immensely .
Let’s also be clear that when I talk about storytelling, I am speaking
about personal narrative. True stories told by the people who lived them.
This is very different than the traditional fable or folktale that many people
associate with the word storytelling . While folktales and fables are
entertaining and can teach us about universal truths and important life
lessons, there is power in personal storytelling that folktales and fables will
never possess.
A folktale or a fable would never have convinced Elysha that I was the
love of her life. My friends would not routinely invite me to play golf if I
promised them a well-told folkta le between swings. I would not be hired for
a job by answering questions with folktales. Nonprofits, corporations,
universities, and school districts would not be able to improve their image
and messaging through fables. You can’t become the life of the party by
telling a good folktale.
Most importantly , folktales and fables do not create the same level of
connection between storyteller and audience as a personal story. I have
never listened to someone tell a folktale and felt more deeply connected to
the storyteller as a result. I may have loved the story and admired the
storyteller ’s skill and expertise,  and I might have been highly entertained,
but I have never felt that I knew the storyteller any better at the end of their
story . The storyteller who tells folktales and fables is a highly developed,
highly skilled delivery mechanism, often more entertaining than television,
radio, or a Y ouTube video, but never revealing, vulnerable, or authentic.
Folktales and fables don’t require vulnerability . They do not demand
honesty and transparency from  the storyteller . They can never be self-
deprecating or revealing, because the story is not about the story teller . They
are entertaining,  possibly educational, and often insightful, but they do not
bring people closer together .
We tell stories to express our hardest, best, most authentic truths. This is
what brings thousands of people to hear stories at theaters and bars every
night in cities all over the world.
They want the real deal. They want the kind of stories that just might
make them fall in love with the storyteller .
As we prepare to embark on this journey together , keep in mind that
there are a few requirements to ensuring that you are telling a personal
story:
Change
Your story must reflect change over time. A story cannot simply be a series
of remarkable events. You must  start out as one version of yourself and end
as something new. The change can be infinitesimal. It need not reflect an
improvement in yourself or your character , but change must happen. Even
the worst movies in the world reflect some change in a character over time.
So must your story. Stories that fail to reflect change over time are
known as anecdotes. Romps. Drinking stories. Vacation stories. They
recount humorous, harrowing, and even heartfelt moments from our lives
that burned brightly but left no lasting mark on our souls.
There is nothing wrong with telling these stories, but don’t expect to
make someone fall in love with you in a Chili’ s restaurant by telling one of
these stories. Don’ t expect people to change their opinions on an important
matter or feel more connected to you through these stories. These are the
roller -coasters and cotton candy of the storytelling world. Supremely fun
and delicious, but ultimately for gettable.
Matt’ s Five Rules of Drinking Stories
1.No one will ever care about your drinking stories as much as you.
2.Drinking stories never impress the type of people who one wants to impress.
3.If you have more than three excellent drinking stories from your entire life, you are
incorrect in your estimation of an excellent drinking story .
4.Even the best drinking stories are seriously compromised if told during the daytime
and/or at the workplace.
5.A drinking story about a moment when you were over the age of forty is often sad,
pathetic, and even tragic except under the following circumstances:
•It is absolutely your best drinking story of all time.
•The storyteller is over seventy . Drinking stories about the elderly are acceptable
in any form, because they are rare and oftentimes hilarious.
Matt’ s Three Rules of V acation Stories
1.No one wants to hear about your vacation.
2.If someone asks to hear about your vacation, they are being polite. See rule #1.
3.If you had a moment that was actually storyworthy while you were on vacation, that is a
story that should be told. But it should not include the quality of the local cuisine or
anything related to the beauty or charm of the destination.
Your Story Only
You must tell your own story and not the stories of others. People would
rather hear the story about what happened to you last night than about what
happened to your friend Pete last night, even if Pete’ s story is better than
your own.  There is immed iacy and grit and inherent vulnerability in hearing
the story  of someone standing before you. It is visceral and real. It takes no
courage to tell Pete’ s story . It requires no hard truth or authentic self.
This doesn’t mean that you can’t tell someone else’s story . It simply
means you must make the story about yourself. You must tell your side of
the story .
Back in 1991, I was living with my best friend, Bengi, in an apartment
in Attleboro, Massachusetts, that we called the Heavy Metal Playhouse. It
was thanks to Bengi that I had a roof over my head. He was attending
Bryant University but decided to live off campus during his sophomore
year. I was graduating from high school at the time, and my parents
expected me to move out and begin taking care of myself.  But I had
nowhere to go. I worried that I might become homeless.
While my classmates were counting down the remaining days of high
school with great anticipation, I spent much of my senior year worried
about where I would be living after the school year ended. Then salvation.
On a warm sprin g evening, while Bengi and I were sitting in the cab of an
idle bulldozer on the site of a future grocery store, he asked me if I wanted
to live with him. I couldn’ t believe it. I was ecstatic.
There was only one problem: I knew that living with Bengi would be
hard, because unlike anyone I had ever met, Bengi was a person who held
on to grudges. Cross him in any way, and he did not forget. I suspect that it
was the result of being an only child and not facing the constant adversity
that comes with sibling rivalry . Growing up as the oldest of five, I was
awful to my siblings. I made their lives miserable. I tricked my brother
Jeremy into believing that the yellow bits in the Kibbles ’n Bits dog food
were real cheese and convin ced him to eat them fairly regularly . I
constantly short -sheeted his bed. Sold his Star Wars action figures to raise
cash. Locked him out of the house every other day. Jeremy had every
reason to despise me.
To his credit, Jeremy occasiona lly enacted his own revenge. When it
came time to vote on a new patrol leader in our Boy Scout troop, Jeremy
orchestrated a coup that placed himself in the leadership positio n that I had
once held and left me powerless to stop him. For a time, I despised him for
making me look like a fool.
But when you grow up with siblings, you learn to forgive and forget.
You have no other choice. As an only child, Bengi lacked that ability .
Instead of forgiving, he would rank his friends on lists according to how he
was feeling abou t them that day, which made things difficult given that we
shared many of the same friends . His inability to forgive made it difficult to
be around him at times. Sometimes impossible.
Then salvation. One night we were sitting in the living room of the
Heavy Metal Playhouse with friends, waiting for The Simpsons  to come  on,
when things finally came to a head. Voices were raised. Heated words were
spoken. In a fit of anger , Bengi stormed out of the house and into a
downpour . He told us he was going for a run.
Bengi was not a runner at the time, and he suffered from a paralyzing
fear of water . He couldn’ t swim, and he wouldn’ t even consider going out
in the rain without a hat to keep the water from his eyes.
Yet he was off, hatless and frantic. He left me sitting along with our
friends in the living room, contemplating what might happe n when he
returned. I wondered if Bengi and I might stop being best frien ds. He was
ideal in so many ways, but I worried that his insistenc e on holding grudges
might be the wedge that would eventually drive us apart. It saddened me. I
sat on that couch and resigned  myself to the idea that this might be the
beginning of the end for us. Eventually my friends and I returned to
watching television as we awaited his return.
Less than an hour later, the door burst open, and a dripping, panting,
red-faced Bengi entered the house. He looked different. Waterlogged
clothing and plastered hair, but he was also smiling. Really smiling. He
looked relaxed. He looked happy . Then he walked over to me, bent down,
and kissed me on the lips.
It was gross. He was wet and panting and hot. And it wasn’ t a peck. It
was a real kiss. His yucky man lips pressed against mine.
Then he took a step to the left and kissed Pat, who was sittin g beside
me. He moved in to kiss a third guy, but by now everyone was on alert and
able to get the hell out of the way .
We stared at him, wide-eyed, wondering what had happened.
Something important had happened. Something enormous. On that run,
Bengi had somehow found a way to let go of every grudge he had ever
held. Somehow he had decided that it wasn’ t worth holding on to them
anymore. He was a new man. He was a better man. He has been that new,
better man ever since.
This is Bengi’ s story of transformation. It was a momentous moment in
his life. A life-altering experience. One of his big stories.
When I told Bengi that I had told the story to a workshop full of
students, he said, “So you tell my stories now?”
“No,” I said. “I told my side of your story . It was a story about a friend
who saved my life, and yet he was also a friend who I didn’ t think would be
my friend forever because of this terrible hang-up about grudges. Then one
night, my friend went for a run and somehow changed himself forever . That
terrible part of him went away . He left it behind in the rain. Then he kissed
me. I thought it was disgusting, but I also knew in that moment that we
would be friends until our dying days.”
“That’ s a pretty good trick,” Bengi said. “You should include  that in
your book.”
So I did.
Don’ t tell other people’ s stories. Tell your own. But feel free to tell your
side of other people ’s stories, as long as you are the protagonist in these
tales.
My wife and I work with Voices of Hope, an organization dedicated to
preserving the stories of the Holocaust. We work with the children of
Holocaust survivors, teaching them to tell their parents’ stories.
But these second-generation survivors don’t really tell their parents’
stories. They tell their own stories, dipping into the past somewhere in the
midst of them to show how the experiences of their parents have changed
their lives too. They share a bit of their parents’ histories, but the stories are
grounded in the storytellers’ lives. The reason these stories work so well is
that they are not history lesso ns or biographical sketches. They are the
stories of the people telling them. The storytellers are the protagonists, so
they are able to bring their own vulnerability , authenticity , and grit to the
tales.
There is the woman whose story opens on a living-room couch.
Schindler ’s List is coming on television, and she wonders if tonight will be
the night when she finally watches this movie. She’s Jewish, and the child
of a Holocaust survivor , and yet she’ s never watched the film before, mostly
because she worries that watchi ng it will bring the stories of her father into
greater focus. Her finger hovers over the power button on her remote
control, paralyze d by indecision. Then she tells about some of her father ’s
experiences during World War II. She explains the horror he witnessed and
the suffering he endured. Then she returns to the couch. The movie is about
to come on. Will tonight be the night she finally watches this film? Can she
finally bear witness to the horro rs of her father ’s youth? She ends the story
by leaving the audience to wond er if this will be the night she finally finds
the courage to watch.
It’s her story , filled with honesty and vulnerability , but embedded within
her own narrative is the story of her father .
There is the woman who drove to her father ’s apartment after he had
fallen on the living-room floor and hurt himself. Waiting for an ambulance
to arrive, she searches the freezer for something frozen to put on his back.
The freezer is packed from top to bottom with food. “Not the Lean
Cuisine!” her father yells from the living room.
Why is her father’s freezer jam-packed with food? He nearly starved
during the Holocaust. As she tells about dealing with an aging parent, she
dips into her father’s experiences during the war, making us understand
how his life today is still dictated by the past in so many ways. Then she
returns to the present and closes the story at her son’s bar mitzvah. Her
father , still in great pain from the fall, has made it to the temple despite that
pain. A man who was once a starving Jewish teenager in Nazi Germany is
now witnessing his grandchild’ s rite of passage. This would have seemed
impossible to that starving boy. Our storyteller talks about how happy she is
to have her dad present at such a momentous occasion. “He can have all the
Lean Cuisine he wants,” she says. “He’ s earned it.”
She’s telling a story about her own life as the daughter of a Holocaust
survivor , but through her telling, we learn much about her father as well.
Then there is the woman who returns to the concentration camp where
her mother was once imprisoned . As she makes her way through the camp,
she juxtaposes what she sees on that day with what her mother witnessed
during the war. The storyteller is standing at the front of her story , talking
about what she sees and feels in the present, but her mother , now deceased,
is right behind her , casting a long shadow over everything.
Each of these storytellers does a brilliant job of telling their own stories ,
complete with all the elements of a well-crafted tale, and yet at the same
time, we come away with a greater understanding of their parents and that
terrible period of history .
A story is like a diamond with many facets. Everyone has a different
relationship to it. If you can find a way of making your particular facet of
the story compelling, you can tell that story as your own. Otherwise, leave
the telling to someone else.
The Dinner Test
Lastly , the story must pass the Dinner Test. The Dinner Test is simply this:
Is the story that you craft for the stage, the boardroom, the sales conference,
or the Sunday sermon similar to the story you would tell a frien d at dinner?
This should be the goal.
The performance version of your story and the casual, dinner-party
version of your story should be kissing cousins. Different, for sure, but not
terribly dif ferent.
This means that you should not build in odd hand gestures. When I see a
storyteller mime the birth of an idea with hands that flutter like butterfly
wings over their head, I think, “You would never do that at the dinner table.
Why now? This isn’ t a theatrical production. Y ou’re just telling a story .”
This means that when I hear a storyteller say that the purple pansies
were particularly pleasant on their plush pillow of purple petunias, I think,
“No one talks like that. This isn’t poetry . You’re just telling a story . No one
would ever have dinner with someone who talked like that.”
This means that when I hear a storyteller begin their story with dialogue
like “Mom, I told you not to look under my bed!” or even a random sound
like, “Boom!” I think, “I would  not eat dinner with someone who started
their story with unattributed dialogue. Why do storytellers think that this is
a good idea?”
Just imagine how this might sound:
Me: Hi, T om. How was your day?
Tom: Not bad. Did I tell you about Liz and the dog?
Me: No. What happened?
Tom: (pauses for a moment and then begins) “Liz, I’m taking the
dog for a walk around the lake!” The screen door slams as Fido
and I run towar d the water .
Me: Check, please.
If you wouldn’ t tell your story at dinner that way, for goodness’ sake
don’t tell it onstage that way. Storytelling is not theater . It is not poetry . It
should be a slightly more crafte d version of the story you would tell your
buddies over beers.
When telling a story to an audience, we play a game with them: we
pretend that we are speaking completely off the cuff. Extemporaneous
storytelling, unprepared and unrehearsed. This is not usually true. While
most storytellers  don’t memorize their stories (and I strongly advise against
it), they are prepared to tell them. They have memorized specif ic beats in a
story . They know their beginnin g and ending lines. They have  memorized
certain laugh lines. They have a plan in place before they begin speaking.
As a player in this game, the audience also pretends that the story is
extemporaneous. Off the cuff. Unprepared and unpracticed. This is what the
audience wants. They want to feel that they are being told a story . They
don’t want to see someone perform a story .
The audience and the storyteller find a common space in between the
extemporaneous and the memo rized, and this is where the best stories
ideally reside.
My hope is that all my stories occupy this space. If they do, they will
pass the Dinner Test. The stories that I tell onstage for thousands of people
should be similar to the versio ns that I would tell for just one person. I
would be less methodical at the dinner table, of course. I would allow for
interruptions. I might be more inclined to offer an amusing observation or
an aside. But essentially it should be the same story .
This is the Dinner Test. It will guarantee that you don’t sound
“performancy” or inauthentic. It will ensure that your audience will think of
you as a regular human being. It will prevent you from sound ing like the
occasional Broadway actor who finds his way downtown to The Moth to
tell a story , complete with dramatic flourishes and over-the-top
vocalization. We hate those people at The Moth. We also hate people who
behave that way in real life. Don’ t be one of those people.
Okay , now you know what a story is and is not. Time to find some good
ones.
CHAPTER THREE
Homework for Life
I’m eating dinner with my family. I’m sitting at the table with my wife,
Elysha, my daughter , Clara, who is five at the time, and my son, Charlie,
who’ s almost three. We’re all enjoying our meal except for Charlie. Charlie
is not eating his dinner . Charlie never eats his dinner . Tonight we’re having
chicken nuggets , and as I hand him a nugget, Charlie throws it onto the
floor . Every chicken nugget that I place in front of him ends up on the
hardwood, and we have the only dog in the world that won’ t eat table
scraps. She’s sitting at my feet, watching these tiny poultry bombs land all
around her . She stares at them blankly .
I’m losing my mind. I’m losing my mind because my daughte r, Clara,
has never thrown a piece of food in her entire life.
She’s perfect. She’ s just like me.
But Charlie is not. For whateve r reason, Charlie throws food at every
meal, and it doesn’ t matter if it’s chopped liver or chocol ate-covered
chocolate. It all ends up on the floor . So I turn to Elysha and I ask, “What
are we going to do about Charlie and the food?”
Elysha tells me that she’s takin g Charlie to the pediatrician tomorrow
for his regular checkup, and says she’ll ask the doctor for advice.
“Great,” I say . I love it when experts solve my problems.
Twenty-four hours later, we’re back at the table having dinner . Tonight
it’s peas. It turns out that Charlie is an Olympic pea-throwing champion. It’ s
as if he’s somehow turned them into antigravity peas. He can make them
roll from the dining room to the kitchen with ease, and he thinks it’s the
greatest thing in the world.
I think he could probably roll peas upstairs if I gave him the chance.
Once again, I’m losing my mind, so I turn to Elysha and ask, “What did
the doctor say about Charlie and the food?”
Elysha stops eating. She puts her fork down and takes a deep breath. I
sense that something important is coming. I steel myself.
She says, “The doctor said that when Charlie throws food, we have to
take all the food away from him, and I know that’s going to be hard for
you.”
She’s right. It’s going to be hard for me to take all the food away from
Charlie, but I don’t know why she would say something like that. I’ve
always been perfectly capable of punishing my kids when needed. As an
elementary-school teacher , I understand the value of painful consequences.
“Why do you say it’ s going to be hard?” I ask.
She takes anothe r deep breath. “I know that when you were a little boy,
you didn’ t always have enoug h food to eat, so taking away food from
Charlie is going to be hard for you.”
This is true too, but I’ve never told Elysha about my childhood hunger .
I’ve never told anyone that when I was a boy, I was hungry most of the
time. It’s a secret that I’ve kept close to my heart, hidden away for decades,
because when you’re poor and hungry , the last thing you do is tell anyone in
the world that you are poor and hungry . It’s a source of great  shame and
embarrassment, especially when you’re a child.
But my wife has spent almost ten years with me. She’s listened to me
talk about my childhood. She’s heard my stories. She’s figured  it out. She
knows my secret.
Then she tells me that every morning, when I put together Clara ’s lunch
for school, I pack more food into her lunch box than a child could ever eat
in a single day. Then after I’ve left for work, Elysha comes downstairs and
unpacks the lunch box. She’s never wanted to tell me this, because she
knows how important it is to me to send my kids to school with enough
food every day . More than enough food.
I’m sitting at my dining-room table, staring across at my wife, when I
realize that she knows me better  than any person in the world. She probably
knows my heart better than I do. It’ s a moment I will never for get.
Here’ s the thing about that story: We experience moments like this all
the time. This one may sound special and unique and maybe even beautiful,
but only because I’ve crafted this particular moment into a story . In truth,
these moments are everywhere. They exist in multitudes for all of us.
They’re like dander in the wind . They exist all around us. More than you
could ever imag ine. The problem is that we don’t see these moments. We
fail to notice them or recognize their importance, and when we happen to
see one, we don’t reach out to catch it. We don’t record it. We don’t save it.
We fail to keep these precious moments safe for the future.
Years ago, I found a way to recognize and collect these moment s, and it
has changed my life. It’s turned me into a storyteller with an endless supply
of storie s. Stories that don’t rely upon near-death experiences or unlawful
imprisonment or homelessness to be effective. It’s also made me a happier
person.
Let me explain. Back in 2013 , I was becoming desperate. I’d been
telling stories onstage for almost two years, and I was head over heels in
love with storytelling. As I continued to perform night after night, I realized
two things:
1.I needed  more stories. If I was going to continue to perform, I
was going to have to generate more content.
2.The stories that my friends initially thought would be great —
the near-death experiences, the arrest and trial for a crime I
didn’ t commit, sharing a bedro om with a goat — are all good
stories. Audiences love them. But the story about Charlie
throwing his food and my wife uncovering my childhood secre t
— a tiny story that takes place at a dining-room table between a
husband and a wife — that’s the kind of story that audiences
love best of all.
Here’ s why: If I tell the story about the time I died on the side of the road
and was brought back to life in the back of an ambulance, it’s going to be
challenging for an audience to connect with my story and with me. It might
be excit ing and compelling and even suspenseful, but audience members
are probably not thinking, “This  is just like the time I died in a car accident
and the paramedics brought me back to life!”
There’ s nothing  in the horror of a car accident for an audience to
connect to. Nothing that rings true in the minds of listeners. Nothing that
evokes memori es of the past. Nothing that changes the way audience
members see themselves or the world around them. But if I tell you about
my secret childhood hunger , that story is much more likely to resonate with
you.
Why? We all have secrets that we hold close to our hearts. Maybe it’s a
secret that you never want anyone to know , or maybe it’s one that you
desperately wish  someone would uncover . Or maybe, like me, you had a
secret that was discovered by a friend or loved  one. Either way, we all know
what it’ s like to have a secret like mine. W e know how powerful and painful
secrets can be.
We all know what hunger feels like. We know what it’s like to want
something impo rtant and essential — food, friendship, acceptance, love —
but never to have enough of it. And we all know what it’s like to feel
embarrassed or ashamed of never having enough of something that you so
desperately need.
If you’re  a parent, you also know what it’s like to want your children’ s
lives to be better  than your own.  You understand the desire to fill that lunch
box to the brim with food.
This is why tiny moments like the one at my dining-room table with my
wife and childre n often make the best stories. These are the moments that
connect with people. These are the stories that touch people’ s hearts.
The story about my wife uncovering my childhood secret, in the full
seven-minute version, is one of the most popular stories that I tell, but it’s
not terribly funny or suspenseful or extraordinary . It doesn’ t involve a near-
death experience  or law-enforcement officers or indoor farm animals. It’s a
simple moment between a husband and wife that has come to mean so
much to me, and in turn to many of my fans.
This is not to say that the big moments, like the time I died on the side
of a snow-covered road two days before Christmas (I tell this story in
chapter 13), can’t make a great story , but it turns out even these big stories
need to be more  about the little moments than the big ones. We’ll get to that
in a later chapter .
As I said, there was a point at which I realized that I’d need to start
finding more stories to tell. I couldn’ t wait for the next time my heart
stopped beating or the next time I was arrested for a crime I didn’ t commit.
I needed to find these little moments. I needed to hunt them down. My goal
was to identify the small stories that existed in my life already .
I’ve been a schoolteacher for almost twenty years, so it was only natural
that I assign myself homework. I assigned myself Homework for Life. This
is what I did:
I decided that at the end of every day, I’d reflect upon my day and ask
myself one simple question:
If I had to tell a story from today — a five-minute story onstag e about
something that took place over the course of this day — what would it be?
As benign and boring and inconsequential as it might seem, what was the
most storyworthy moment from my day?
I decide d not to write the entire story down, because to do so would
require too much time and effort. As desperate as I was for stories, even I
wouldn’ t be able to commit to writing a full story every day, especially if it
wasn’ t all that compelling. Instead I would write a snippet. A sentence or
two that captured the momen t from the day. Just enough for me to
remember the moment and recall it clearly on a later date.
I also allowed myself to record any meaningful memories that came to
mind over the course of the day, in response either to something I added to
the spreadsheet or something that came to mind organically . Oftentimes
these were recovered memories: moments from my past that had been
forgotten for years but had returned to my mind through the process of
doing Homework for Life.
To do this work, I decided to use an Excel spreadsheet. It works  well for
several reasons. First, it forced me to capture these moments in just a few
words. As you can see, my spreadsheet is broken into two columns: the date
and the story . That’s it. As a result, I don’t allow myself to write more than
the story cell allows. For a nove list who is accustomed to writin g hundreds
and sometimes thousands of words per day, the temptation to write more
was great, but I believe in simplicity . I believe in strategies that are easy to
apply and maintain even on our busiest days. This is the best way to
develop a habit.
10/29/15 Jaime and Monica’ s wedding: First family wedding ever . So much was missed that
can never be recovered. Always feel like an outsider .
10/30/15 Hit the ball onto the first green again.
10/31/15 Elysha is horrified by my Meatloaf Pandora station.
1 1/1/15 Didn’ t connect my work voicemail until November 1. Only missed one call. Kids
answering phone. Kids protecting me from phone call.
1 1/2/15 Started taking yoga.
1 1/3/15 I couldn’ t wait to get to school today to see David and hassle him about the Giants.
More than anything else. Crazy .
1 1/4/15 I went through the tollbooth on the bridge without any money or my EZ Pass.
Terrified. W orried about strangers when I normally don’ t care. Berated by
tollbooth operator . Ticketed.
1 1/5/15 Taught Clara about the Rolling Stones while lying in bed with her .
Walked Kaleigh. 2:00 AM. Underwear . Birds. Rain. Beauty .
When I’m 12 years old, I find out that Measleman, our childhood dog, is named
after the doc who gave my father his vasectomy . Tonight, for the first time, I
realize that my father lost his dog in the divorce, too. How awful.
I’m 18 years old, and I’m having sex with J. on the 18th green of a golf course in
Walpole. Sprinklers kick on at midnight. SO MUCH W ATER. SO MUCH
LAUGHTER. Never laughed while naked with a girl so much.
Woman in vet had brand-new puppy . So excited. W anted to tell her the joy and
heartache ahead. Y ikes! Same with my kids?
1 1/6/15 Dog humped my leg at Petco. W oman is less than apologetic. I guess rightfully so.
Meaningless apologies.
1 1/7/15 I prefer to write at McDonald’ s because I like racial and socioeconomic diversity
as opposed to cashmere and American Express (divorced dad, employee).
Sam emails me about life coaching. Friends divorce. Susan as a divorce
consultant.
1 1/8/15 Faculty hoops game. Same strategy as Pete Dechecco game. Not much changes.
1 1/9/15 Man gets in line at Southwest Airlines, has moment with me, now my best friend,
now trying to skip line, now a jerk, but still, my only friend.
1 1/10/15 I make dinner . Hot dogs and macaroni and cheese. The only dinner I can actually
make.
1 1/1 1/15 I brought canned jellied cranberry sauce to my class’ s Thanksgiving Day feast and
was loved for it.
1 1/12/15 Megan is so disappointed in Chris. I made Megan into the manager she is today .
Mommy too.
1 1/13/15 I made Haley cry by accident by accusing her of pushing when she was not. Later ,
kids came to her defense and Stacey explained to me that girls are more
complicated than I know .
1 1/14/15 Clara makes snowman almost without my help. So proud. So afraid that she won’ t
need me much longer .
Charlie has taken to head-butting me and gouging my eyes out. Considering that
he was ignoring me prior to this, I see the violent streak as an improvement.
1 1/15/15 I hit on Elysha by spending an hour of my morning getting the kids dressed,
folding laundry , doing dishes, and cooking pancakes.
By creating a system requiring that I write only a few sentences a day, I
was also sure that I’d never miss a day, and this is important. Miss one day,
and you’ll allow  yourself to miss two. Miss two days, and you’ll skip a
week. Skip a week and you’re no longer doing your Homework for Life.
Moreover , by placing these most storyworthy moments in a spreadsheet,
I could sort them for later use. I could copy , cut, and paste these ideas into
other spreadsheets easily , allowing me to ultimately separate the truly
storyworthy ideas from the ones that merely had potential.
Finally , by placing the stories in a spreadsheet, I was better able to see
patterns in my life, and sometimes these patterns became stories too.
For example, Elysha and I never fight. We may disagree at times, but
even those moments are rare. We have never raised our voices to each other
and have never said anything that required an apology . It’s disgusting. I
know .
Then one day last year, at the onset of the summer , Elysha asked me to
install the air conditioners in the windows throughout our home. I didn’ t
want to. When we were lookin g at houses years ago, we both agreed that
central air was a nonnegotiable . We had to have it. Then we caved at the
last minute and bought a hous e without central air. I was admittedly on
board at the time. I liked the house a lot and agreed to the concession.
But I’m annoye d at myself today for not holding out for a home with
AC. Putting the air conditioners into the windows each year is a reminder of
how I failed to hold the line on this nonnegotiable point.
The air conditio ners also get heavier every year, which of course is not
the case, but it certainly seems as if they do. They serve as annual
reminders of my slow march toward death and the inevitab ility of my
mortality . Each year I grow weaker and frailer . I hate it.
I don’ t handle my mortality well at all.
So I told Elysha, “No. Not today . I’m not putting in the air cond itioners.
I don’ t feel like it!”
“Okay ,” she answered from the living room. “No problem.”
Then I stewed for ten minutes. Thoughts swirled in my head: Easy for
her to ask me to install the damn  air conditioners. She doesn’ t have to carry
them up from the basement. Besides, I grew up without a single air
conditioner in my house. She can handle one more hot day without her
precious cool air . I have things to do. Mor e important things than carry four
air conditioners up two flights of stairs and jam them into window casings.
I quietly grumbled and groused for ten minutes, and then, in a huff, I
stomped down the stairs to the basement and started bring ing the air
conditioners up, banging them around a little more than necessary and
grunting as I did so.
“Are you okay?” Elysha called from the other room.
“I’m fine!” I called back. “I’m bringing up the air conditioners.”
“Oh,” she said, her voice as sweet as pie. “Thanks!”
She had no idea how annoyed I was. In truth, I don’ t think she cared one
bit if I brought the air conditioners up on that day or three weeks later. She
had no idea how I was feeling. I jammed those air conditioners into the
windows while stewing in my own petty , infantile anger .
That was the story I recorded  that day. Not exactly a storyworthy
moment in its own right, but perhaps an anecdote for a larger story
someday .
Two months later, I reacted the same way when she asked if I could
mow the lawn. I protested. I grumbled silently about her request. I paced
back and forth in a huff. Then  I mowed the lawn. Angrily . Pushing that
lawn mower as if I wanted it dead.
Seeing that same behavior appear twice on my list made me realize
something surprising: I do fight with my wife. I just don’t fight with words.
I fight by grudgingly and loudly  doing chores that I don’t want to do. I yell
at her by bangin g air conditioners into walls and pushing my lawn mower
furiously across the grass in neat, even rows.
Best of all, she has no idea that any of this is going on.
This pattern-turned-realization became a very funny story about my
marriage that audiences love, and I learned something about myself and my
marriage in the process too. My spreadsheet allowed me to see this pattern.
When I started my Homework for Life, I didn’ t know what the results
would be. At best, I hoped to find a handful of stories that I might be able to
tell onstage someday .
Instead, somethi ng amazing happened. As I reflected on each day of my
life and identified the most storyworthy moments, I began to develop a
storytelling lens — one that is now sharp and clear . With this lens, I began
to see that my life is filled with stories. Moments of real meanin g that I had
never noticed before were suddenly staring me in the face. You won’ t
believe how plentiful they are.
There are moments when you connect with someone in a new and
unexpected way. Moments when your heart fills with joy or breaks into tiny
pieces. Moments when your position on an issue suddenly shifts or your
opinion of a person changes  forever . Moments when you discover
something new about yourself or the world for the first time. Moments
when a person says something you never want to forget or desperately wish
you could for get.
Not every day contains a storyworthy moment for me, but I found that
the longer I did my homework , the more days did contain one. My wife
likes to say that I can turn any moment into a good story , and my friend
Plato has said that I can turn the act of picking up a pebble from the ground
into a great story . Neither of these statements is true. The truth is this: I
simply see more storyworthy moments in the day than most people. They
don’t go unnoticed, as they once did.
I discovered that there is beauty and import in my life that I never
would have imagined before doing my homework, and that these small,
unexpected mom ents of beauty are oftentimes some of my most  compelling
stories.
Look at the highlighted item on my spreadsheet, for example. It reads:
Walked Kaleigh. 2:00 AM. Underwear . Birds. Rain. Beauty .
What does this mean?
My dog, Kaleigh, wakes me up at two in the morning. She almost never
does this, so I’m surprised. Annoyed too. It’s clear she needs to pee. I’m
wearing a pair of Valentine-themed satin boxers, given to me by my
mother -in-law (a fact I try hard to forget every time I put them on), and
nothing else.
I have a decision to make: take the time to get dressed or bring the dog
out while I’m wearing nothing more than my boxers.
It’s early November , but we’re in the midst of a bout of warm weather . I
live on one of those short side streets that you don’t drive on unless you live
on the street. I know all my neighbors. None of them are the type to be
awake in the middle of the night. And it’s two in the morning. I’ll likely
have the street to myself.
“Fine,” I say , staring down at Kaleigh from my bed. “Let’ s go.”
I bring her onto the lawn and wait as she does her business. My boxers-
only decision is looking good. I’ll be back in bed in no time.
But apparently peeing is not enough for Kaleigh, because once she’s
done, she turns and starts walking down the street. I’m still only wearing
my boxers, but I think, “This will be fine. I live on a little street with almost
no traffic. It’s two in the morni ng. No one will ever see me. And even if
they do, I’m wearing boxers. Practically gym shorts.”
So I walk with my dog under the yellow glow of streetlights. The air is
cool. The sky is starless. Kaleigh  has an unusual bounce in her step. Her tail
is wagging. She’s happy . When  we reach the end of my street , where she
typically turns back for home, she pauses. Looks back at me. Then she turns
right.
Great. She wants to walk around the block. And it’s a busy block once
we’re off my street. One more right turn, and we’ll find ourselves on Main
Street. Still, it’s the middle of the night. How many people are driving
around at 2:00 AM? And Kaleigh looks so damn happy .
Fine, I decide. W e’ll go around the block.
I start walking. It’s a nice walk. If you’ve ever been outside in the
middle of the night, you know that the birds are louder when  the sun is
down than any other time of the day. They sing their hearts out at 2:00 AM.
On this night, they are especially loud. Riotous. So here I am, walking my
dog around the block, listening to the birds sing, wearing nothing but boxer
shorts. It’ s a little crazy , but it’ s fine. Nice, even. Unnerving but nice.
We turn right again onto Main Street, the farthest point on the block
from my home and one of the busiest streets in town, when  something
unexpected happ ens. It’s one of those moments when it wasn’ t raining, and
then one second  later, it’s a downpour . Noah’ s Ark–level precipi tation. I am
instantly soaked.
Now I know why the sky was starless. Storm clouds were overhead.
Now I know why the birds were so riotous. They knew what was
coming.
So here I am, with my dog and my boxers and the birds and the rain,
and I still have two sides of this block to walk before we’re home. And now
I’m on Main Street. It’s the middle of the night, but still, it’s called Main
Street for precisely what’ s happe ning right now. Cars and trucks  are passing
me by .
Years ago, I would have been angry at this turn of events. Angry with
myself for blund ering into this mess, and angry with Kaleigh for dragging
me to this point. I would have  seen nothing in this moment other than a
forgettable series of terrible decisions, extreme irritation, and likely
embarrassment. I probably would have picked up Kaleigh and marched her
home, swearing most of the way .
Fortunately , on that day I had my storytelling lens intact. By then, my
lens was well developed. So I stopped on that corner despite the rain and
the location and my scanty boxers, and I looked down at Kaleigh. She
looked up at me. Her tail was still wagging. Her tongue was hanging out in
a doggy smile.
This occurs to me: Kaleigh is fourteen years old. She is my best friend.
I’ve lived with her longer than I’ve lived with my wife, but I know that
she’s not going to be around for much longer . She’s old. She’s been
hobbling a bit. She’s already survived a ruptured disk and back surgery.
She’s reached the end of her expected life span. This might be the last time
that we walk in the rain together .
So I stand on that corner in the pouring rain and soak in the moment in
all its glory . It is beautiful. Crazy and absurd but beautiful.
What would have been just annoying and forgettable five years ago is
now something that I’ve captured and will have for the rest of my life. Just
from reflecting, absorbing, and recording that moment, it will never be lost
to me. I don’t know what else happened on that day, but when  I see those
words:
Walked Kaleigh. 2:00 AM. Underwear . Birds. Rain. Beauty .
I am right back on that corner  with the birds and the rain and my best
friend. And when I’m lying on my deathbed centuries from now, I’ll be able
to look back on that spreadsheet, see that handful of words, and return to
that time and place as if I’m a time traveler . At that point, my best friend
will have been dead and buried for years, but in my mind’ s eye, I will see
her as clear as day .
I never expected any of this to happen. In searching for stories, I
discovered that my life is filled  with them. Filled with preciou s moments
that once seemed decidedly less than precious. Filled with mom ents that are
more storyworthy than I’d ever imagined. I’d just been failin g to notice
them. Or discou nting them. Or ignoring them. In some instance s, I tried to
forget them completely .
Now I can see them. I can’t help but see them. They are everywher e. I
collect them. Record them. Craft them. I tell them onstage. I share them on
the golf course and to dinner companions. But most important, I hold them
close to my heart. They are my most treasured possessions.
But that’s not all. Other amazing  things began to happen as well. As that
storytelling lens became more refined and I started seeing stories in my
everyday life, stories began welling up from my childhood that I’d long
since forgotten. It was like digging into the earth and suddenly striking a
geyser .
It happened that night in the rain with Kaleigh. I’m standing on that
corner in the rain, staring down  at Kaleigh, who is still smiling up at me,
when a new memory fills my mind. One of those unexpected geysers. It’s
the image of Measleman, a beagle mutt that my family owned when I was a
boy.
Measleman, the first dog that I loved with all my heart, who was named
after the doctor who gave my father his vasectomy . Measleman, who
followed my father wherever he went. Measleman, whom  my father
thought of as a third son and I thought of as a four-legged broth er. Kaleigh
has momentarily  disappeared. Main Street and the birds and my boxers
have disappeared. Measleman is suddenly filling my mind’ s eye.
Standing on that corner in the rain, I can see Measleman as if he were
standing beside me, smiling at me the same way Kaleigh was smiling at me
a moment ago. Long tongue hanging out of his mouth. Panting. Sitting tall
on his haunches . The combination of a memory of a dog long since dead
with my aging dog of today somehow sparks a thought in my mind, and I
realize — for the first time in my life — that not only did my father lose his
wife, children, home, horse farm, and horses when my mother left him for
another man, but he also lost his dog, Measleman.
My father moved into a room behind a liquor store and was forced to
leave his Measleman behind. Not only did my father lose the dog he loved
so much, but Measleman becam e the property of the man who’d stolen his
wife and usurped his family .
As I stand in that warm rain, it somehow feels like the worst loss of all,
and suddenly the shame that my father must have felt in losin g his home
and family to another man is my own. For the first time in my life, I look
upon my father ’s losses through the eyes of a man instead of the eyes of a
boy, and I realize how complicated, painful, and terrible it all must have
been for him.
Another story . A much more difficult story to tell, but one I will tell
someday .
Just as quickly , that memory is replaced by another . Now  I’m a
teenager , having sex with a girl named Jennifer on the eighteenth green of a
local golf course when the sprinklers fire off at midnight, producing more
water than I ever thought possible, drenching us as the rain is drenching me
right now. The combination of the downpour and my half nakedness have
returned this memory to me.
What a memory . I have never laughed so much while naked with a girl.
We were as rioto us as the birds are now on that night, but until this moment
on this corner , that memory had been lost to me.
Two more storyworthy moments, both probably suitable for the stage if
crafted properly , but also mome nts that I am grateful to have unexpectedly
recovered. The memories come back so quickly and in such force that there
are times when I need to brush them away .
All of this happens because I sit down every evening and ask myself:
What is my story from today? What is the thing about today that has made
it dif ferent from any previous day? Then I write my answer down.
That’ s it. That’ s all I do. If you do it, before long you will have more
stories than you could ever imagine.
I know many professional storytellers, including some of my favorites,
who only have a handful of stories to share. I ask them to perform in shows
that I produce, and they tell me they can’t. They don’t have any more good
stories.
I tell these storytellers that my current list of untold story ideas is more
than five hundred items long. They think this number is crazy . They say it’s
impossible. I think it’ s crazy that they don’ t do Homework for Life.
But even if you’re not in the story-collecting business (and you should
be if you’re reading this book ), other remarkable things will begin to
happen when you do Homework for Life.
I received one of the best phone  calls of my life from a Homework for
Life convert. When I answered the phone, there was a woman on the other
end, and she was crying. My initial thought: “Oh, no. Who is this? What
terrible thing has happened?”
The wom an doesn’t tell me her name. She’s just crying. A second later
she starts talkin g. She tells me that she took a storytelling workshop with
me six months before. She had listened closely as I assigned her Homework
for Life, and she started doing it that night. She’s calling to tell me that
she’s fifty-two years old, and for her entire life, she’d never felt like an
important person  in this world. She’d always thought that she was just like
everyone else — simply anothe r face in the crowd — and that one day in
the future, she was going to die and “go out quietly . Unnoticed.”
Then she started doing my Homework for Life, and within three
months, it had changed her life. She says that searching for stories in her
everyday life and recording them has made her feel like an important
person for the first time. She tells me that she has real stories — important
and significant moments in her life that she had never seen before — and
that she feels that they are a part of a much larger story . She says she feels
like a critical cog in the gears of the universe. Her life matters. She tells me
that she can’t wait to get out of bed every morning and find out what will be
the thing that makes that day dif ferent than the last.
It’s probably the best phone call I’ve ever received, and I never got the
woman’ s name. She thanked me and hung up while she was still crying.
But it’s true. As you start to see importance and meaning in each day,
you suddenly understand your importance to this world. You start to see
how the meaningful moments that we experience every day contribute to
the lives of others and to the world. You start to sense the critical nature of
your very existence. There are no more throwaway days. Every day can
change the world in some small  way. In fact, every day has been changing
the world for as long as you’ve been alive. Y ou just haven’ t noticed yet.
I hear accounts like this all the time. A workshop graduate once  told me
that she’s not doing Homework  for Life to find stories, because she has no
intention of ever taking the stage and performing. But Homework for Life
has become therapeutic for her. It’s made her life richer and fuller , so she
can’t stop now, even if she wanted to. Another workshop graduate told me,
“It’s the most important thing that I have ever done in my life.” Another
told me, “It saved my life.” Still another said, “It’s like I can see the air
now.”
As work shop student Anne McGrath wrote in a recent blog post on
Brevity:
Here’ s the most incredible thing I’ve discovered: this habit of
collecting ideas has changed something in my mind and how I am in
the world. It has instilled in me a sense of patience, made me see
with wonder, be more willing to try new things, and look with fresh,
curious eyes. The process  of writing has become more important
than the outcome  or me and I feel fortunate every day that I am able
to create  something. I have stumbled upon things in New York City
I might have missed if I was less attentive — an exhibit of
Nabokov’ s butterflies at the public library , a baby squirrel fallen
from its nest in Central Park, the homeless woman outside the
subway station who had been a Jackie Gleason dancer . Visceral
stories are floating all around us, waiting to be brought to life.
It’s not just me. This strategy works.
There’ s an added bonus to Homework for Life. It’s unrelated to
storytelling, but it’s worth ment ioning. It might just be the most important
reason to do the exercise. As you begin to take stock of your days, find
those moments — see them and record them — time will begin to slow
down for you. The pace of your life will relax.
We live in a day and age when people constantly say things like:
Time flies.
That last school year went by in the blink of an eye.
I can’ t even r emember what I did last Thursday .
I feel like my twenties went by in a flash.
I used to feel the same way. Then I started doing Homework for Life,
and the world slowed down for me. Days creep by at rema rkably slow
speeds. W eeks feel like months. Months feel like years.
I cannot tell you what a blessing this is. I don’t lose a day anymore. I
can look at any one of those entries on my spreadsheet from the years I
have been doing my homework,  and I am right back in that moment. And I
will have these moments forever . When I am on my deathbed, I’ll be able to
look back at an Excel spreadsheet filled with moments from my life. It’ll
probably be a hologram by then, hovering over my body , but as I scroll
through the pages, I’ll be able to return to every one of those moments.
Every one of the moments that made one day different from the rest. A
lifetime of storyworthy moments at my fingertips.
I found this unexpected gift while desperately searching for stories, and
it has changed my life. It can change yours too.
I conducted a storytelling works hop for principals and administrators in
my school district a few summers ago. I assigned them Homework for Life.
Five months later, at another training session, one of the principals
approached me and said, “Y ou know why your Homework for Life works?”
“No,” I said, desperately trying to remember his name.
“I’ve missed three days since that training. Three days when I forgot to
write down my story for that day, and it kills me. I lost three days, and I’m
so angry about it. I’ll never get those days back. That’ s how I know it
works.”
Over the years, I have assigned Homework for Life to thousands of
people, but only a small percentage has begun doing it. A tragically small
percentage. This is because Hom ework for Life requires two things that are
often lacking in the world today:
Commitment and faith.
Commitment that you will sit down every night and reflect upon your
day. It’s crazy to think that you won’ t give five minutes a day over to
something that will change your life, but many won’ t.
Instead, you’ll blindly give two hours of your life over to a television
show that you will barely remember a year later. You’ll give at least that
much time to aimless surfing of the internet and the liking of baby photos
on Facebook, but you won’ t give five minutes of your day to change your
life.
You may also lack faith, because this change won’ t happen instantly ,
and in this world, most people want their results instantaneous ly. But this
process does not happen overnight. It didn’ t happen immediately for me.
The stories that I was finding and recording early on were not very good. I
couldn’ t see the moments of true meaning, nor could I distin guish them
from moments that might be interesting, or even amusing, but ultimately
carry no weight. My storytelling lens had not yet been focused and refined,
but I was so desperate to find stories that I refused to stop. I kept on doing
my homework, even when it seemed pointless, because I was desperate to
remain on the stage, and I thought that finding even one story would make
it all worth it.
It may take you a month, six months, or even a year to refine and focus
your storytelling  lens. You might give up five minutes of your day for an
entire year and receive nothing in return. This process requires you to
believe that eventually you will begin seeing these moments in your life,
just as I and so many others have. Once it starts to happen, you will find
your life changed forever .
Last week my daughter , Clara, who’ s nine years old now, asked me to
pick her up. It was early in the morning, and she was feeling sleepy and a
little sad that the weekend was over and we were heading back to school.
I pick Clara up every time she asks, because I know that at some point,
probably sooner  than later, she will be too heavy for me to lift, or even
worse, she will stop asking.
So I’m holding Clara in my arms in our living room. The morn ing light
is casting a warm, yellow glow in the room. The house is quiet. She and I
are the only two awake. She wraps her arms around my neck and holds me
tight.
A minut e later my arms start to shake. I’m struggling to keep her aloft.
My right foot, which has a torn ligament, begins to throb. I decide to put her
down.
At that very moment, Clara pushes her face into the crook of my neck
and whispers, “It’ s just so nice to be held this close.”
Then it occurs to me: I’m the only person in the world who picks up my
daughter like this anymore. She’s become too big for my wife or her
grandparents to lift. I’m the last person who will ever hold her like this. I’m
the last person who will hold her like a little girl.
I tighten my hold on her. I ignore my throbbing foot and tiring muscles.
I whisper back, “Let’ s just stay like this for a little bit. Okay?”
“Sounds great, Daddy ,” she whispers back.
We hold each other in the growing light of a spring morning until she
sighs and whispers, “Okay , let’s eat.”
If I hadn ’t been doing my Homework for Life, this moment would have
been lost to me. Even if I had recognized its importance (which is doubtful),
I would have been hard-pressed to recall it years later .
If you’r e a parent, you know this is true. Our lives are filled with
beautiful, unfor gettable moments with our children that turn out to be
entirely and tragically for gettable.
But now I will own that moment for the rest of my life. I can close my
eyes today and return to that room, with the morning light streaming
through the windows, my daughter pressed close to me, whispering words
that I will never for get.
Someday that moment may find its way into a story .
Nowadays, Homework for Life doesn’ t even take me five minutes.
Today I can see most of the moments while in the midst of them. I
recognize them in real time. I have often inputted them into my spreadsheet
long before the end of the day. This will eventually happen for you too. If
you have commitment and faith.
I give this to you: Homework for Life.
Five minutes a day is all I’m asking. At the end of every day, take a
moment and sit down. Reflect upon your day. Find your most storyworthy
moment, even if it doesn’ t feel very storyworthy . Write it down.  Not the
whole story, but a few sentenc es at most. Something that will keep you
moving, and will make it feel doable. That will allow you to do it the next
day. If you have commitment and faith, you will find storie s. So many
stories.
There are meani ngful, life-chang ing moments happening in your life all
the time. That dander in the wind will blow by you for the rest of your life
unless you learn to see it, captur e it, hold on to it, and find a way to keep it
in your heart forever .
If you want to be a storyteller , this is your first step. Find your stories.
Collect them. Save them forever .
In addition to my many other jobs, I’m an elementary-school teacher , so
I feel like I have the right to assign homework to anyone I choose.
I choose you.
STORY BREAK
Naked in Brazil
I’m telling stories to an audie nce of about seven hundred high-school
students at an American schoo l in São Paulo, Brazil, in the summer of
2015. When I finish performing,  I open the session to questions. They come
fast and furious.
I love Q&A. Ask me a question, and I’ll tell you a story .
I’ve been answering questions for about fifteen minutes, hand ing out
prizes to students who ask me especially challenging questions, when a
student asks me:
“You write novels. You blog every day. You write musicals and
magazine articles. You tell stories on stages. Why? Why do you share so
much of yourself?”
I stop. I think for a moment. I’ve never been asked this question before.
An unexpected answer comes to mind. “I think . . .” I say slowly ,
wondering if the answer I’m about to give is correct. Trying it on for size.
“I think,” I repeat, “that I’m trying to get the attention of a mother who
never paid me any attention and is now dead and a father who left me as a
boy and never came home.”
It’s a remarkable thing. I have been writing every single day of my life
since I was seventeen years old, without exception. I have been blogging
every single day of my life since 2003, sharing my thoughts, ideas,
complaints, and moments from my life with thousands of readers. I’ve been
publishing novels since 2009. And I’ve been standing on stages  since 2011,
spilling my guts, sharing my deepest, darkest secrets and most
embarrassing, hilarious moments, and not once did I ever ask myself,
“Why?”
“Why do you do it, Matt? Why  do you share so much of yours elf with
the world?”
Now I know . Standing in the carpeted aisle of an auditorium five
thousand miles from home, I have stumbled upon the answer to a question I
never asked.
That is storytelling at its finest.
The auditorium goes silent. I go silent. Seven hundred teenagers stare at
me, waiting for my next move.
After a moment , I say, “Okay , remember when we talked about finding
those five-secon d moments in our lives? Those moments of transformation?
Realization? I think I’m having one right now . Yup. I am. Definitely .”
I still stand by that answer today . I have yet to craft or tell the story
about the time I discovered my primary reason for writing and telling so
many stories (in front of seven  hundred Brazilian teenagers), but I will
someday .
The young lady who asked me that question received a prize that day .
CHAPTER FOUR
Dreaming at the End of Your Pen
I don’ t dream well.
When I was twenty-two years old, I was robbed at gunpoin t while
managing a McDonald’ s restaurant in Brockton, Massachusetts. Guns were
pressed to my head and triggers  pulled in an attempt to force me to open a
lockbox at the bottom of the safe.
I didn’ t have the key to the lockbox, as a placard on the safe clearly
indicated. The gunmen didn’ t believe me or the placard and thought they
could get me to open the lockbox by convincing me that I was about to die.
Knowing that these men had killed a Taco Bell employee the week before, I
was certain that they were serious. I was convinced that this was the end of
my life.
It’s one of my big stories.
I first told this story at a Moth GrandSLAM in Brooklyn’ s Music Hall
of Williamsbur g in 2013, but I have no recollection of telling it. The
performance isn’t a blur; it’s a perfect hole in my memory . A total loss of
seven minutes of my life, even though those seven minutes were spent
onstage in front of more than four hundred people.
More on this in a later chapter .
Two years later I told a more complete version of the story in a Moth
Mainstage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music under the brilliant direction
of The Moth’ s artistic director , Catherine Burns. Y ou can find a recording of
that performance on the “Storyworthy the Book” YouTube channel. We will
be looking at this story more closely in a later chapter as well.
As a result of the robbery and my failure to seek treatment, I suffered
from untreated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for more than twenty
years. When Elysha and I started dating in 2004, she asked me why I woke
up every night screaming and crying and shaking like a leaf.
I told her it was “my thing.”
Some people collect stamps. Others ski. Some people like to bake
cookies. I suffer from reoccurr ing dreams of a horrific robbery and the
absolute certainty that I am about to die.
“Relax,” I told her . “It’s just my thing.”
Elysha told me that my nightmares did not qualify as a “thing” and sent
me to a therapis t. He discovered that in addition to my nightm ares, I had
lived a life of constant anxiety and meticulous precision in an effort to deal
with my trauma.
Among the many things that he discovered (that I already knew):
•I create a menta l map of the entrances and exits of every space
that I enter .
•I position myself so that I can monitor the primary entrance to
any space that I occupy .
•I consta ntly catalog potential threats as they enter and exit a
space.
•I keep a basebal l bat under my bed and have escape plans from
every room in my home in the event of a home invasion. When
Elysha and I began living together , I reviewed these escape plans
with her regularly .
•What was most concerning to my therapist was that I would hear
the click of the gun while wide awake. As I was walking down
the street. Reading a book. Driving a car . Watching television.
It turns out that Elysha was right. I was a bit of a mess. Two years and
many therapy sessions later, I stopped hearing the click of the gun while
walking down the street. I relaxed a bit. My need to constantly plan my
every moment receded. My anxiety level decreased significantly .
Best of all, my nightmares have become far less frequent. They aren’ t
gone by a long shot, and they probably never will be, but I can get through
entire nights without seeing those three masked men and their guns in my
dreams.
Those are very good nights for me. On those nights, I dream the dreams
of a normal person. Dreams that I adore. Loosely constructed narratives that
often diver ge and intersect along odd, incomprehensible, and incongruent
routes, filled with overlapping ideas and images of every variety . Kind of
like Alice in W onderland  on steroid-filled mushrooms.
Even with a journal at my bedside, it’s almost impossible to remember
any of these dreams, and rarely do I generate any useful ideas or content
from them. But I have developed a way of engaging in a version of this
dreamlike state while I am awake that has been incredibly productive and
has resulted in many ideas for stories, anecdotes for stories, and much more.
It’s also damn good for your soul.
Crash & Burn
The exercise is called Crash & Burn. It’s a simple concept, and certainly not
groundbreaking in any way, but it relies on adhering to a few simple rules
that I have developed that are necessary to make the exercise work well.
Essentially Crash & Burn is stream-of-consciousness writing. I like to
think of it as dreaming on the end of your pen, because when it’s working
well, it will mimic the free-associative thought patterns that so many of us
experience while dreaming.
Stream of consciousness is the act of speaking or writin g down
whatever thoug ht that enters your mind, regardless of how strange,
incongruous, or even embarrassing it may be. People have been utilizing
stream-of-consciousness strategies for a long time, beginning first with
psychologists in the late nineteenth century . In the twentieth century , these
strategies were adopted by writers and thinkers as a means of generating
new ideas. Entire novels have been written to mimic stream-of-
consciousness thinking.
I hate those novels.
But for our storytelling purpo ses, we will be utilizing stream-of-
consciousness writing to generate new ideas and resurrect old memories,
applying three important rules:
Rule #1: Y ou must not get attached to any one idea.
The goal of Crash & Burn is to allow unexpected ideas to intersect and
overrun current ones, just as that rain-drenched corner of Main Street with
my dog produced an important revelation about my father and a memory of
sex on a golf course. Two intersecting ideas crashed into and overran the
meaningful moment that I was experiencing with Kaleigh.
So, regardless of how intriguing or compelling your current idea may
be, you must release it immediately when a new idea comes crashing in,
even if your new idea seems decidedly less compelling than the original
one. When Crash & Burn is at its best, ideas are constantly crashing the
party , slashing and burning the previous ones. It’s in these intersections of
ideas that new ideas and memories are unearthed.
Rule #2: Y ou must not judge any thought or idea that appears in
your mind.
Everything must land on the page, regardless of how ridiculous,
nonsensical, absurd, or humiliating it may be. Similarly , grammar ,
punctuation, and capitalization are meaningless. Penmanship is irrelevant.
This can be difficult for many people. For years, writing teach ers have
demanded that students think about grammar , spelling, and punctuation as
they write. They have required students to outline their essays  and stories
before placing a single word on the page. They have handed their students
archaic graphic organizers and insisted that they be complet ed prior to
writing. They have ignored the reality of writing, which is this:
Many writers have no idea what their next sentence or paragraph will
be. Much of writing is done in the dark. The next sentence is often as much
of a surprise to the writer as it is to the reader .
The artificial demands of outlines, graphic organizers, and planning
often subvert the creative process and force would-be writers to think about
what they are writing before a word even hits the page rather than allowing
them to spill their guts and evaluate the material later. This is because
writing teachers  often are not writers themselves and therefore never
engage in the writing process in an authentic, honest way. Rather than
teaching the writing process followed by actual writers, they speculate
about strategies that might help a writer or follow the advice written in
writing tomes by people who only write writing tomes, often doing more
damage than good.
When it comes to Crash & Burn, you must free yourself of this dreadful,
hobbling, ingrai ned need to prepare and self-monitor . You must spill your
guts on the page, free from judgment or worry about whether what you are
writing is good or right. Just put the damn words on the page as they appear
in your head and on your fingertips. Ignore your inner demons.
Rule #3: Y ou cannot allow the pen to stop moving.
I say pen because, although I do almost all my writing on a keyboard, I
have found that engaging in Crash & Burn with a pen tends to trigger
greater creativity (and there is some science to support this claim). But if
you must use a keyboard, go for it.
Either way, your hand or fingers cannot stop moving. You must
continue writing words even when your mind is empty . To make this
happen, I use colors. When I have no other thought in my mind, I begin
listing colors on the page until one of them triggers a thought or memory .
For example:
Red, green, blue, black, brown . . . I tell kids that brown is my
favorite color , and it makes them all crazy , which makes no sense,
but in truth, I have no favorite color, which makes them even crazier
. . .
Writing down numbers is also a popular strategy utilized by my
workshop students, though I recommend that the numbers be listed in word
form.  For example:
One, two, three, four, five . . . I have five fingers on each hand, and
there are scars on five no six of them, which seems like a lot, but
maybe not . . .
I’ve known frequent travelers to list countries. I had a mechanic in one
of my workshops list engine parts. I had a teenager in a workshop list the
names of his previous girlfriends (and apparently had more than enough
names to work with). It doesn’ t matter what you choose. Your list of items
simply needs to be long and familiar to you.
That’ s it. Set a timer for ten minutes, follow these three rules, and go.
Here is an example of one of my Crash & Burn sessions from a recent
workshop. When I’m teaching, I speak my Crash & Burn aloud as I write so
my students can hear how my mind is working. Specifically , I want them to
hear:
•how new ideas come crashing in.
•how I embrace these new ideas without hesitation or judgment.
•how I am willin g to leave a good idea behind in favor of a new
one, regardless of how little promise the new idea seems to hold.
•how I manage to keep my hand moving at all times.
If you go to the StoryworthytheB ook YouTube channel, you can see me
engage in this process, speaking it aloud as I do in my workshops. But
below is a Crash & Burn final product, transcribed from pen to digital text.
I always  launch my Crash & Burn sessions with an object in the room,
but you can start any way you want. On this day, there was a bowl of grapes
on a table, so I started with the word grape . Slash marks indicate the
moments when new ideas or memories came crashing in.
Grape. Grape juice. White grap e juice / When I was a kid I stepped
on a broken Mello Yello glass bottle and cut my foot — got infected

Once I’ve finish ed with a session, I look back and pull out threads that
are worth saving . Story ideas. Anecdotes for future stories. Memories that I
want to record. New ideas. Interesting thoughts.
Here is an annotated look at what I produced in those ten minutes:
Grape. Grape juice. White grap e juice / When I was a kid I stepped
on a broken Mello Yello glass bottle and cut my foot — got infected
— happened by a pond /
I have no idea how grape juice brought me to Mello Yello, but my mind
somehow made  the connection, and it brought me back to a day of
swimming with my family at a water hole when I was five or six years old.
I had forgotten about the Mello Yello bottle and the cut on my foot until
this Crash & Burn session, but more importantly , it brought back another
memory from that day, not recorded during my session, because  a new idea
came crashing in, a much more meaningful memory than the one about my
infected foot.
It was a memor y of my father jumping in the pond from the edge of a
large, flat rock and remaining underwater for so long that I was sure he was
dead. I was absolutely certain  that he had drowned before my eyes. I
remember a wave of crushing sadness washing over me, overwhelming me.
My father was gone. The only man I loved was lifeless on the bottom of the
pond. I knew in that moment that my life had changed forever .
As I opened my mouth to screa m, my father ’s head emer ged amidst a
patch of lily pads, and “forever”  had miraculously come to an end. Life was
instantaneously returned to normal. Rarely have I experienced such an
emotional swing in my life.
It turns out that I have inherited my father ’s ability to hold his breath for
a frighte ningly long time. Over the years, I have terrified many people,
including my wife, by disappear ing under the water for excessive periods of
time, never once thinking about that moment by the pond when I thought I
had lost my father forever . This is probably a story that I will tell someday .
oh, the pond, Yawgoog had three differ ent waterfr onts and Asha way
Aquatic Center — I never took / I was a lifeguar d at Yawgoog — so
boring so dumb to be a lifegua rd at a Boy Scout camp — at least
you give yourself a chance to look at girls but I saved that kid who
couldn’ t swim and didn’ t want to tell anyone /
The mem ory of the Mello Yello water hole triggered memories of Yawgoog
Pond, at the center of Yawgoog Scout Reservation. Yawgoog was the Boy
Scout camp where I spent many summer days as a boy. The bit about the
stupidity of working as a lifeguard at an all-boys’ camp might be worth
exploring for part of an essay or perhaps for my stand-up routine. It feels
funny . Or at least potentially funny .
As for the boy who nearly drowned (after being too embarr assed to
admit that he couldn’ t swim), I had forgotten about that moment entirely
until this Crash & Burn session, and it will certainly make a good story
someday .
when Eric and what’ s his name ? Rory yes Rory flipped their canoe
adults facing away fr om pond and Jeff and I went to /
Yawgoog Pond brought me to a pond in Vermont. While visiting friends at
their vacation home years ago, a boy named Eric and his friend Rory turned
over their canoe over in the middle of the pond. The two boys weren’ t
wearing life jackets, so they were clinging to the edge of their submer ged
canoe for dear life. My friend Jeff and I were the only adults who noticed
that the boys were in trouble, so we raced out in a canoe to help. The boys
credited us with saving their lives, but in truth they could have clung to
their canoe for quite a while. I was still happy to take the credit.
Possibly a story , or at least part of a story .
A more storywo rthy moment from that visit to Vermont came when Eric
walked in on my wife, Elysha, fully naked and six months pregn ant. Elysha
nearly killed the poor boy, who ran for his life and later denied seeing
anything, though we all knew that was impossible.
By some bizarre twist of fate, Elysha would become Eric’ s fifth-grade
teacher two years later , making him perhaps the only ten-year -old boy in the
history of American education to see his elementary-school teacher fully
naked while pregnant. Now that is a story that needs to be told.
As you know , I’m simply needing to tell my facet of the story .
a pirate  is a criminal on the sea — I should commit a crime on the
sea so I can be legally called a pirate /
Something about the memory of racing onto that lake in a canoe brought the
idea of piracy to my mind. I’m not sure if committing a crime at sea would
make me a pirate, but it felt right when I wrote it.
If it’s true, and if I need not be arrested or convicted of a crime to be
classified as a pirate, I may add this to my bucket list. Commit some petty
crime — steal silverware from a riverboat cruise — so I can add “pirate”
(or even better , “buccaneer”) to my résumé.
I was a criminal but if you’r e found not guilty were you never a
criminal or a former criminal? actually I was definitely a criminal:
mailbox baseball and stealing the shoes lots of other crimes — isn’t
everyone a criminal or am I just especially bad / list of crimes would
be / story about a guy who commits a crime at sea just to be a pirate
and wears an eye patch for effect /
In 1991, I was arrested and tried for a crime I didn’ t commit. Even though I
was ultimately found not guilty in a court of law, did my arrest make me a
criminal? At least for a while?
What about all the crimes that I’ve committed over my lifetime but was
never caught or prosecuted for? Destroying private property in endless
games of mailbox baseball (a game in which you score a home run by
knocking a mailbox off its foundation with one blow from a baseball bat).
Stealing shoes and a display table from a children’ s shoe store. Making and
selling fake driver ’s licenses to underage college students. Picking up
hitchhikers. Posing as a charity worker to steal money from would-be
donors (a story that we will look at in close detail). Driving over a “No
Parking” sign on the front lawn of a church. Smashing the windshield of my
ex-stepfather ’s car multiple times.
Do these criminal acts make me a criminal? Is my list of unprosecuted
crimes lengthier than most? Are these crimes more egregious than most?
These are questions that migh t be worth exploring in a blog post or
magazine piece.
I used to walk the train tracks as a kid but I wouldn’ t want my kids
to walk the tracks even though it must be safe, right? how does a
train sneak up on you? Not possible /
I really can’t say how piracy and crime led me to memories of time spent
walking the train tracks as a child, but it did. It’s one of the benefits of
Crash & Burn. It allows for random thoughts to enter your mind at any
moment.
From a frighteningly early age, I was permitted to roam free, without
any adult supervision. I would often leave my house just after sunrise,
armed with a peanut-butter -and-jelly sandwich in a paper bag, and would
not return home until dinnertime. And some of that freedom was spent —
for reaso ns I can’t explain today — walking with friends on the railroad
tracks that cut through town. I hadn’t thought of this memory for years until
this Crash & Burn session.
I write for several magazines, including Parents. This feels like the
basis for a parenting essay or perhaps a blog post.
nail polish for women has weird and crazy names maybe I could do
something with it / green red yellow blue gray / The Confeder ates
wore gray uniforms, right? Seems like the least inspiring color —
British wor e red to conceal blood and make fellow soldiers /
Once again, I can’t explain how railroad tracks transitioned to nail polish,
but this is Crash & Burn at its best. Random, incongruous, inexplicable
thoughts colliding.
Regardless of how the mental  leap was made, I happen to know a
person whose job is to assign  names to nail-polish colors. Something
humorous could  be done with these names, perhaps as part of my stand-up
routine or as an amusing detail in a story .
I took that ASVAB test and would love to see the results — I had no
idea what kind of job I might have landed in military — thank God I
didn’ t re-sign at 17 I wonder what / I took the pledge at 17 in a fake
way and then had to take it again at 18 and refused thinking I would
but does that make me a bad guy of some kind?/
Thoughts of Civil War soldiers led me to memories of my encounter with
the United States Army . Whe n I was seventeen, I took the military
placement test, accepted a position in the army , signed a contract, and swore
an oath in front of an American flag.
I knew that the contract and oath were only symbolic. Since I was only
seventeen, I knew I would need  to re-sign my contract and have the oath
readministered when I turned eighteen and became legally eligible to sign.
The recruiter used the symbolic contract and oath as a bit of pomp and
circumstance to make me feel committed to the army , but I knew exactly
what I was doing: opening a door to an opportunity that I might or might
not walk through upon graduation from high school.
Ultimately , I chose not to re-sign the contract. As you know , I moved in
with Bengi. The recruiter was not happy . He and I had quite  the verbal
confrontation. It was one of my first real arguments with an adult who was
not a parent or a teacher . There is probably a story to tell here, and I hadn’ t
thought about that experience in years. I would also like to see the results of
my testing, though they probably don’ t exist anymore.
bad guy the black and the white  is inconvenient Stephen King says
that the side of the good is the side of the white which I like but sort
of places it in unintentionally racist terms similar to “forgot the face
of your father” is gr eat but /
The phrase bad guy triggere d thoughts of the way that good and evil are
characterized in Stephen King’ s Dark Tower series, which I had recently
reread. King’ s characters refer to the side of the good as the side of the
white. I like the nonreligious nature of this characterization, but it also feels
a little racist. I wish it didn’ t.
Characters in the Dark Tower novels also say that a person who does a
foolish thing has “forgotten the face of his father .” I like this expression a
lot too, but it’ s admittedly patriarchal. I also wish it wasn’ t.
I can’ t imagine doing much with these bits.
haven’ t read Dad’ s letter yet why am I so scared all I want is a
relationship and /
The phrase the face of your father  caused me to think of the face of my own
father . I rarely see my dad and barely know him, but he sent me a letter
three weeks ago. I have yet to open the envelope. I’m afraid of what he may
have said or not said in the letter , so it remains sealed. I’m protecting my
heart, at least for now .
I feel this might be the start of a story . I’m probably in the midst of the
story , still waiting for the end.
Addendum: I opened the letter two weeks after this Crash & Burn session. I
was sitting in a movie theater with my wife, watching comme rcials flash
across the screen, when I remov ed the letter from my pocket, opened it, and
read.
Elysha asked why I had chosen  this odd moment to read my father ’s
letter — in a movie theater minutes before the trailers were set to begin. I
explained that if my father ’s words were disappointing or upsett ing, I would
have a two-hour comedy to help me forget my troubles. It was my way of
protecting myself from possible pain. This has now become a story that I
tell, beginning with the moment first recorded during my Crash & Burn
session.
This was a productive session. T en minutes of ef fort yielded:
•six potentially new stories
•three amusing anecdotes / possible stand-up bits
•three possible magazine articles / blog posts
•one possible addition to the résumé (pirate)
Stories are gold. Precious and priceless. Finding six potentially new stories
is thrilling.
Even better , I recovered memories from my past that had been lost to
me until I sat down to write. Forgotten moments that will remain with me
now until the day I die.
With each recovered memory , my life feels more expansive and
significant. The years gather greater meaning and purpose. Surprising,
significant assoc iations between the past and the present are discovered. My
life beco mes brighter and sharper and better with every mem ory that is
uncovered.
The reason is simple: We are the sum of our experienc es, the
culmination of everything that has come before. The more we know about
our past, the better we know ourselves. The greater our storehouse of
memory , the more complete our personal narrative becomes. Our life begins
to feel full and complete and important.
As I said, Crash & Burn is damn good for the soul.
Instead of the five minutes a day that I’ve asked you to dedicate to
Homework for Life, this exercise requires about fifteen minutes at a time.
Although I think it’s a highly productive exercise, I realize that fifteen
minutes every day is asking a lot.
So I’m asking a lot. Do it every day. Close Facebook and Twitter and
Instagram. Ignore your children for a quarter hour. Turn off the television.
Find a quiet room with a lock on the door. Make it the bathroom or a close t
if necessary . Give everyone in your home a cookie and tell them to go away
for a little while.
Author Zadie Smith says, “Protect the time and space in which you
write. Keep everybody away from it, even the people who are most
important to you.” She’s right. Storytellers must selfishly guard their time,
especially from the people they love most.
Storytellers need to know how to tell a good story , but they also need
good stories to tell. Lots of them. Crash & Burn will not only give you the
content you will need, but it will change the way you perceive yourself and
your life in the process.
Give me fifteen minutes a day, and I’ll guarantee you some amazing
results.
In case you were wondering, my father wrote me a beautiful and hilarious
letter describing his recent foray into gardening. Avoiding  the issues
surrounding our relationship (or lack thereof), he offered me a glimpse into
a life that I want to know better . Since that first letter , we have exchanged
about a dozen in all and continue to write. I don’t know if my father and I
will ever be able to spend much time together or open our hearts to each
other , but these letters have been a blessing for me, and, I hope, for him.
STORY BREAK
Storytelling Instruction Can Apparently Be
Romantic
In 2014,  I was teaching a storytelling workshop in Hartford, Connecticut.
There were about thirty people sitting in a group in front of me, and one by
one, they were explaining what had brought them to the workshop on this
day.
People attend my workshops for a wide range of reasons. There are
business folks looking to improve their communication skills. Attorneys
and doctors wanting to explain things better to clients and patients.
Ministers and rabbis seeking ways to improve their sermons. Grandparents
hoping to get their grandchildren to pay attention. Archivists with
basements full of stuff that they want people to see. People looking to
improve their dating prospects.
Knowing what has brought my students to a workshop can often help
me cater to their needs. At this particular one, I had already learned that one
couple had driven from Toronto and another man had driven from
Philadelphia to spend the day with me.
I was not happy . I like a low bar. When people travel eight or ten hours
to spend the day with you, the stakes are high.
I pointed to a couple in the front row that I thought I recognized. “And
why are you two here?”
They explained that it was their wedding anniversary , and in lieu of a
weekend in Vermont, they had chosen to spend their anniver sary in my
workshop. “W e attend your Speak Up events all the time, so we thought this
might be fun too.”
They had even brought a bottle of champagne.
It was an honor to have someo ne think that my workshop would be a
good way to celebrate their anniversary .
It was also unfairly nerve-racking and set a bar way too high. I can be
entertaining for ten or fifteen minutes onstage, but an eight-hour workshop?
Not possible.
CHAPTER FIVE
First Last Best Worst: Great for
Long Car Rides, First Dates, and
Finding Stories
I spend a lot of time searching for stories.  Perhaps you’ve noticed. In
truth, if I retired from storytelling tomorrow , I’d still be on a relentless
search for new stories.
Not only are stories the currency I need to continue entertaining
audiences, but more importantly , finding new stories both fills in and fills
out my life. They  bring breadth and meaning to my life. Recalling a
forgotten moment from your life or suddenly seeing it as more than what
you once thought can expand the boundaries of your perceived life, while
filling in gaps and connecting disparate memories into a more complete
picture. Stories will both fill in the holes in the mental map of your life and
help you to see how expansive that map truly is. It’ s priceless.
Let me explain. As you know , when I was eighteen years old, I was
kicked out of my childhood home. I wasn’ t physically removed.  My clothes
weren’ t tossed onto the street. My parents didn’ t change the locks or stick a
“No Trespassing ” sign into the front lawn. The expectation was simply that
I would move out and make my own way upon graduating from high
school. To reinforce this expectation, I was given a set of bath towels and a
microwave for my eighteenth birthday . Pots and pans and a toaster for
Christmas. A vacuum cleaner on graduation day. The message was clear:
it’s time to hit the road, kid.
Despite an excellent GPA and a list of extracurricular activities that
included champion pole-vaulter , middling bassoonist, op-ed writer for the
school newspaper , and founder  of the short-lived chess club, no parent,
teacher , or guidance counselor ever spoke the word college  to me. While
my friends were being called out of class to discuss SAT scores, safety
schools, and financial aid, I sat quietly at my desk and waited for my turn.
It never came. I’ll never understand why. As a result, I came to believe
that college was not meant for me. I would have to find my own way .
This was not going to be easy for me. I was not a terribly brave person.
I was spectacularly unadventurous. I was a creature of routine and habit. I
hardly felt equipped to take on the world. I grew up in a tiny town of less
than five thousand people and rarely strayed beyond the town limits. My
family never went on vacations, never went to the beach or the mountains
or anywhere in between. I never traveled anywhere unless I was tagging
along with friends or flying to California with the marching band. Now all
of that ordinariness was about to be upended with my graduation from high
school. I was a small-town boy who needed to suddenly find his way in the
world, and I wasn’ t close to being ready .
During my junior year, I took my first steps to try to secure my future. I
applied for a job at a McDonald’ s restaurant in Milford, Massac husetts, and
was hired on the spot. Within six months, I had been promoted to manager
and was working full-time despite my full class load.
I turned  out to have all the qualities needed in an effective restaurant
manager . I was quick on my feet. Made good decisions. Kept my cool. I had
the stamina required to work twelve-hour shifts without complaint. As the
eldest of five and a longtime leader in the Boy Scouts, I had acquired an
innate understanding of how to motivate a multitude of personalities. Most
important, I had the desperate desire for someone — anyone — to finally
notice me and acknowledge that I was capable of doing something well. As
a result, I worked my ass off to become the best McDonald’ s manager I
could possibly be. During my senior year of high school, I was named
Manager of the Year for my regional district — an award never before
given to a high-school student. I would win that award three years in a row .
By the time I graduated from high school, I had a secure, albeit low-
paying job that I could depend upon. A stable source of income.
But I still had no home. No prospects for a future residence. No idea
how to rent an apartment or find a roommate. When the world lacked an
internet, informa tion was at a premium, and I had none. While my friends
were worrying about college-ac ceptance letters and prom dates, I spent my
senior year worrying about where I would be living in June.
That all changed  on that night in early May, when Bengi and I climbed
into the cab of that idle bulldo zer and planned our future together. Bengi
was finishing his freshman year at Bryant University in nearby Smithfield,
Rhode Island. Tired of living in the dorms, Bengi asked if I would be
willing to move in with him off campus while he finished his last three
years of school.
As you already know from chapter 2, I said yes. But what you don’t
know is that I practically shouted my answer into the night. I breathed an
enormous sigh of relief. I had found my next home.
Bengi and I moved into a townhouse in Attleboro, Massachuse tts, with
a third friend named Tom, who lasted less than a year before returning
home broke. Attleboro was equidistant from Bryant University and my
restaurant, maki ng it an ideal location for us, but neither one of us knew the
area at all. We found a grocery store, two or three fast-food restauran ts, a
gas station, and the local dance club, all within a mile or two of our home.
The town seemed small but sufficient. As teenage boys, we didn’ t need
much.
I’d been living in Attleboro for about a year when I found  myself
driving down Route 152 — the main drag — and noticed that a long line of
cars were turning left at a traffic light. I’d driven through the intersection
hundreds of times before but never considered where the left might take me.
I got curious. I suddenly needed to know where this street led. So even
though I was running late, I turned left and followed the procession of
vehicles. I drove about half a mile down the street before reaching another
traffic light. I looked left and right, wondering which way to turn, and I
couldn’ t believe my eyes.
I had discovered  another main drag, bigger than the one I’d just been
driving on. Just from this spot in the intersection, I could see a McDonald’ s
restaurant, a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a bowling alley , a pizza place, a
sandwich shop, another grocery store, and much more. It was a whole new
world of food, entertainment, and retail options almost within walking
distance of our home.
Running even later now, I turned left and drove, taking inventory of the
multitude of businesses that lined the street. I couldn’ t wait to tell Bengi of
my discovery . As I passed a pair of gas stations, I saw the on-ramps to
Interstate 495 — a highway I drove almost every day of my life — and just
like that, enormo us pieces of my mental map of the area clicked into place.
Sections of one part of town connected with the other , and in an instant, my
understanding of Attleboro’ s geography coalesced in my mind. A single
exploratory turn had changed everything.
Something else far more import ant happened that day. A boy who had
never driven far from home suddenly felt like an explorer . I hadn’ t traveled
more than five miles from our townhouse, but this was the first time that I
had followed a road just to see where it led. This was the first time I had
driven into undiscovered territ ory for the purposes of disco very. I felt
unfettered for the first time in my life. It was such a small, seemingly
inconsequential decision, and yet it changed everything that was to follow .
Two weeks later I drove into Boston for the first time to see comedian
Steven Wright perform. A city that once frightened me was suddenly just
waiting to be explored. A month later I made my first trip into New York
City to watch my beloved New York Yankees play the hated Boston Red
Sox. Before long I was traveling  throughout New England and beyond. The
beaches and the mountains were all suddenly within reach. I traveled to
New Hampshire for girls and New York for comedy . I drove  to Virginia
with a girlfriend on a whim to see the famed two-headed cow in their state
fair. I drove to Ohio with Bengi  to visit the Football Hall of Fame. I drove
up and down the coast, from Maine to Florida, chasing girls, lying on
beaches, and playing video games. I visited Disney World for the first time
and old Y ankee Stadium for the last time.
One left-hand turn had filled in my mental map of Attleboro and filled
out all the other possibilities on the map. Where I once saw limits and
danger , I now see endless possibility .
Finding stories from your life can have the same effect. They can fill in
the forgotten moments of your life while expanding your previously
perceived boundaries. Moments that once lacked meaning and relevance
can suddenly be recognized as critical and essential to your life story .
Make it your mission to find, see, remember , and identify stories, and
you will begin to see your life in a new and more compelling light.
The last story-finding exercise — and one that’s ideal for this filling-in
and filling-out process — is adapted from an idea given to me by The
Moth’ s artistic director , Catherine Burns. She shared this method for
generating story ideas as we watched our children play in the museum one
day, and I’ve since turned her idea into a workshop exercise that I use quite
often.
It’s called First Last Best W orst. All you need to play is pen and paper .
As you can see from the worksheet that follows, the top row of the page
(the x-axis) is labeled with the words “First,” “Last,” “Best,” and “Worst,”
along with a column labeled “Prompts.” Along the left side of the page (the
y-axis), the prompts are listed.  The prompts are the possible triggers for
memories.
What was your first kiss?
What was your last kiss?
What was your best kiss?
What was your worst kiss?
For each of these prompts, you fill in the word or words that indicate the
answers to those questions. That’ s it.
The sheet here contains the list of prompts that I use most often in my
beginner ’s workshops, and it also contains my responses.

After completing my chart, I analyze it. Specifically , I ask myself three
questions:
1.Do any entries appear more than once (the signal of a likely
story)?
2.Could I turn any of these entries into useful anecdotes?
3.Could I turn any of these entries into fully realized stories?
I mark potential stories (or stories that I have already told) with an S. I mark
potential anecdotes with an A. Below is the same sheet, now marked for
possible stories and anecdotes.

Here are some details of the analysis: The Datsun B210 appea rs three
times on the chart, and the best gift entry , “Friends as family ,” also pertains
to the Datsun. These four entries are all related to “This Is Going to Suck,”
the story of one of my near-death experiences as the result of a car accident.
I won a Moth GrandSLAM championship with this story , and it’s been
featured on The Moth Radio Hour  several times.
My worst gift, bath towels, will be part of the sequel to “This Is Going
to Suck,” which will tell the hilarious and heartbreaking story of Christmas
Day spent in the pediatric ward of the hospital following the accident.
My first kiss entry , “Laura,” and my first travel entry , “Pasaden a 1988,”
are also related. My first kiss took place in Pasadena, California, on January
1, 1988, with my high-school sweetheart, Laura Marchand. I told the story
of that kiss (“The Promise”) at a Moth GrandSLAM championship, and it’s
also been featured on The Moth Radio Hour . It’s one of my most popular
and most requested stories.
I’ve also told stories related to my best car (1976 Chevy Mali bu), my
worst pet (Prudence), my first trouble (corner in kinder garte n), my best
trouble (inciting riot upon myself), and my worst trouble (arrest) at Moth
GrandSLAM championships in New York and Boston, winn ing two of
them.
I have yet to tell the story of my best kiss (Elysha), my worst kiss
(Sheila), my first pet (Measlem an), my best pet (Kaleigh, who has at least
three stories attached to her), my best travel (honeymoon), my last pets
(Toby & Pluto), or my worst travel (Disney with Cushman). All have great
potential and will likely be told as stories onstage someday .
The anecdote called “Mysterio us head wound” relates to an incident
that happened when I was three years old. I emer ged from my bedroom
with a gaping wound in my forehead that left me with my first set of
stitches and a cross-shaped scar on my forehead (which  was later
obliterated when  I went throug h the windshield of a Datsun B210). My
parents were never able to deter mine the cause of the injury . I think it could
make for an interesting anecdote in a story about the brief period when my
parents were still married and the few precious memories I have from that
time.
The other anecd ote (Lewiston, Maine) is from a recent trip I took to
perform in Maine, where I met a young Muslim woman who confirmed that
she was gay by watching lesbian pornography on a laptop provided by her
school. I’m not sure how that might fit into a story , but it’s interesting
enough to me to add to my list.
In all, nineteen of the twenty-eight possible entries could be told as
stories. This is admittedly a high percentage, but there are two things to
keep in mind:
1.I have a highly developed lens for stories. I may be able to see
them in moments where you cannot yet. But if you’re doing
your Homework for Life, you will develop a similar lens before
long.
2.These are highly suggestive prompts that typically generate lots
of ideas . I use them in workshops for that reason. They are
prime real estate for finding stories.
Recently a class challenged me to complete a chart of prompts that they

The results are admittedly not as good. I have blanks in several places,
where I simply had no memory  of a moment that fits the prompt. Still, I
managed to find eight stories in twenty possible prompts (though it’s not
actually eight, because some of these items apply to the same story).
My last and worst trees (Sarah and Emma) are trees in the front yard of
my home. My daughter , Clara, named the trees and fell in love with them
more than any person has loved a tree. When Emma became diseased a few
years ago, she had to be taken down, breaking Clara’ s heart. She still walks
over the spot where Emma once  stood and grieves the loss. I could turn this
into a sweet story about my sensitive, perhaps oversensitive, daughter .
My first tree, the oak at the bottom of my childhood driveway , is
already featured  in a story entitled “My Sister and the Toilet,” and it could
easily appear in other stories as well. It was the tree my siblings  and I stood
beneath for years while waiti ng for the school bus, and many things
happened during those long waits.
The best toaster was thrown at a guy named Mike who was trying to
leave a party at the Heavy Meta l Playhouse while intoxicated. I eventually
blocked his car with mine, hoping that he would give up and agree to stay.
Instead he began ramming his rear bumper into my car until I finally moved
it.
My wors t toaster was one of the gifts my parents gave me in preparation
for my departure after graduation, and therefore it will be part of the sequel
to “This Is Going to Suck.”
The best and worst flags are the same flag. Years ago, one of my fifth-
grade students — a boy named  Nathan — decided to exercise  his right to
not pledge allegiance to the flag each morning in protest of the reference to
God in the pledge. While his classmates stood with their hands over their
hearts, Nathan remained seated and silent. His silent protest went almost
unnoticed until I was absent one day and my substitute teacher forced him
to stand and pledge allegiance. Nathan attempted to protest, but the teacher
refused to listen. The entire class was so outraged by this unfair demand
that they refused  to pledge allegiance to the flag for the rest of the school
year, in support of Nathan and in protest of what had been done to him.
This was a Moth StorySLAM winner . When I told that story in
Connecticut, Nathan was in the audience with his family . His father wept.
“Electric socks for Mom” were the socks worn by my mother after she
had seriously injured her back while working in a hospital pharmacy .
Instead of settling her disabilit y claim, the hospital administrators forced
her to accept a job as a security guard (a job they deemed possible with her
back injury), even though she was barely five feet tall and weighed eighty-
nine pounds. They were hoping to get her to quit rather than pay her claim.
They forced her to work outdoors during the winter , and it was her battery-
powered electric  socks — equipped with enormous D batteries — that kept
her feet warm enough to make it through the winter before the hospital
officials finally capitulated and settled her claim. It’s a story about my
inability to help my mother in her direst hour, and I had forgotten it until
my class of fered me the prompt.
As you can see, I also found three new anecdotes — two completely
forgotten until prompted — making it a highly productive First Last Best
Worst session for me (much to the dismay of my students, who were hoping
to prove  me wrong). Even when  the prompts are intentionally uninteresting,
First Last Best W orst works.
First Last Best Worst is a game that can be played many ways. For
someone on the hunt for stories , you can play alone, as I often  do. Prompt
yourself, using objects in the room, a random page in a dictionary , or ideas
you hear on the television or a podcast.
In class, we use First Last Best Worst as an improv game. You are given
a prompt and must tell a story using the first, last, best, or worst version of
that prom pt. Not only does it generate storytelling ideas, but in class it helps
promote extemporaneous-speaking skills and teaches my students to utilize
the skills and strategies we learn in class without rehearsa l. The best
storytellers can spin a hilarious and heartbreaking tale with little or no
preparation. Eventually it becomes as natural as walking or breathing. That
is what I want each of my students to be able to do.
First Last Best Worst is also an excellent game for long car rides, first
dates, or other moments of poten tial awkwardness and silence, or simply as
a means  of getting to know a person better . Regardless of where or how you
play, I promise you that it will generate story ideas for you, and more
importantly , you will find yourself filling in  and filling out  your life, making
connections never seen before and expanding your memory beyond what
you might have thought possible.
I’ve given you three tools to find stories.

CHAPTER SIX
“Charity Thief”
I’m starting part 2 of this book with a story because I’ll be using it to
model the skills  and strategies that follow . This doesn’ t mean that it’s my
best or my most popular story . It’s simply one of my most crafted stories.
Perfect for teaching.
I first told it at a Moth StoryS LAM in New York City. I finished in
second place (and had a mem orable encounter with The Moth founder
Geor ge Dawes Green, which I will discuss in a later chap ter), then I
recrafted the story and told it at a Moth StorySLAM in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. My name was drawn first that night. Although I ended up
with the spot most loathed by storytellers, I won the slam — the only time
I’ve ever won (or seen anyone win) from first position.
The story is transcribed from a performance at one of my shows and is
lightly edited for the page. I mention this because stories that are told orally
differ greatly from stories written for the page. You’ll see that there is less
formality and more repetition. I’ve left all of these elements here to give
you a sense of what the live version sounds like. You can also listen to the
live version of the story on the “Storyworthy the Book” Y ouTube channel.
It’s the fall of 1991. I’m twenty years old. I’m driving down a lonely stretch
of New Hampshire highway . I’m driving home from the very first booty
call of my entire life, and I’m excited because I don’t know that this is also
going to be the very last booty call of my entire life.
It’s in this moment of exciteme nt that the right front tire of my 1976
Chevy Malibu blows out, but it doesn’ t just deflate. It disin tegrates. It
throws rubber and wire across the road in a way I didn’ t think was possible,
and it takes everything I have to get the car over to the shoulder and to a
stop.
And it’s 1991. I don’t have a cell phone. I don’t have a spare tire. I
haven’ t seen a car on this stretch of road for a long time. So I do the only
thing I can think of doing: I start hiking back up the road to search for help.
Seven hours later, after having given all my money to a half-naked
mountain man named Winston in exchange for a balding spare tire, I’m
back on the road, heading home, a hundred miles between me and my
apartment in Attleboro, Massach usetts, when I look at the instrument panel
and see that I have no gas.
All the money I had — every penny to my name — is in the hands of a
half-naked mountain man. I don’t have a credit card. I don’t have an ATM
card. I don’ t even have a checking account.
So I take the next exit and roll my car into a Citgo station, and as I park
the car on the edge of the lot, facing a field of fall foliage, I grip the steering
wheel in anger . I’m angry , but I’m also sad. I’m twenty years old. I’m a
McDonald’ s manager . I make $7.25 an hour, and I am the richest person I
know . My mother is living on welfare with my pregnant teenage sister . My
brother joined the army a year ago, and I haven’ t heard from him since. My
father disappear ed from my life ten years ago. The only person I know who
can help me, who even has a credit card or a car that can make this
hundred-mile trip to New Hamp shire, is my friend Bengi, and he is off on
some college weekend. I can’ t get in touch with him, because in 1991, when
you want to call someone, you need to make a phone ring on a wall, and
you need to make that phone ring at the moment the person you want to
speak to is near that phone, and you need the number for the phone to make
it ring, and all of that is impossible for me to get.
This was not the plan for my life. I’m sitting behind the wheel , staring
into a field of bright colors, yet I feel anything but bright. I was not
supposed to be this alone this early in my life. You’re not supposed to be
twenty years old and have absolutely no one in your life to call for help. As
I sit there in my car, staring into that field of orange and yellow , I see my
future ahead of me. An endless series of moments just like this one, when I
need help but will have none.
So I make a plan. I’m going to beg for gas, because it’s 1991. Gas is
eighty-five cents a gallon, so eight dollars is all I need to get me home. I’ll
offer my license , my wallet, everything in my car as collateral in exchange
for eight dollars ’ worth of gas and the promise that I will return and repay
the money and more. Whatever it takes.
So I rehearse my pitch, take a deep breath, and walk in. There’ s a kid
behind the counter , probably about my age. I tell him my problem. I ask
him to help. I make my offer. The kid refuses. He doesn’ t want to risk his
job.
So I leave. I go back to my car. My plan is simple. I’m going to wait for
this kid to go home. Wait for the next person to come on duty, and while I
wait, I’ll refine my pitch. I’ll beg again. I’ll beg until someone, anyone,
gives me some money for gas. But as I climb back into the car, I see my
crumpled McDo nald’ s uniform on the backseat, and I suddenly have an
idea.
An hour later , I’m standing on the porch of a small, red-brick house on a
quiet residential street. I’m knocking on a blue door .
I’m wearing my McDonald’ s manager ’s uniform. Blue shirt. Blue pants.
Blue tie. Gold name badge. I’m holding a gray McDonald’ s briefcase with a
big M engraved on the front like a shield.
I knock on that blue door again.
When the door opens, a man is standing in front of me. He looks about
fifty, but he might as well be five hundred. He’s one of these guys who
looks as if he has all the wisdom of the world wrapped up in him, and in
that moment, I know that he knows that I’m about to do something terrible.
And I agree. This is a terrible idea. I know this now .
But it’ s two o’clock on a Sunday afternoon. I’m standing on his porch in
a McDonald’ s uniform. It’s one of those moments when you realize that the
only way to get out of a terrible situation is to go through with it. So I take
another deep breath and say, “Hi, I’m Matt, and I’m collecting money for
Ronald McDonald Children’ s Charities.”
The man doesn’ t move. He doesn’ t say a word. He’s like Stonehenge.
Frozen in time and forever waiting for this moment. Waiting for me to
arrive.
The next words that come out of my mouth surprise me as much as they
surprise him, because they are completely unplanned. “My mom died of
cancer when I was a little boy, and now my sister is dying of cancer , and
I’m just trying to do whatever I can to help.”
The man finally  moves. He points his finger at me and says, “You stay
right there.” Then he walks back into his house, and I know what he’s
doing. He’s calling the police, and they will come and arrest me for stealing
money from McDonald’ s (whic h will actually happen two years later, but
not on this day). On this day, he returns to the door with a twenty-dollar bill
in his hand, which is like $20,000 to me on this day. As I raise my hand to
say, “No, it’s too much,” he says, “No. My wife, Lisa, died of cancer five
years ago.”
Now it’ s my turn to freeze.
He keeps talking. He tells me about her cancer . Her death. He tells me
that his two kids came back from California for the funeral, but he hasn’ t
seen them since that day. He says that the last two years of Lisa’ s life were
hard, but it was the very last year that he regrets the most. He tells me how
hard his wife fought to stay alive, and he wishes now that he could have
told her that it was okay to go, but he loved her too much to say the words.
Before I realize  what is happen ing, I’m sitting on the porch with this
man as he spills his guts to me, and in that moment, I know that I am,
without a doubt, the single worst person on the face of the earth.
The man talks to me for twenty minutes about his wife and his children,
and when he’s done, he hugs me as if he hasn’ t hugged a person in five
years. Then he presses the twenty-dollar bill into my hand. It feels like
poison now .
I say good-bye. I walk down the stone path, up the street, and back to
the gas station. I use his money to put gas in my car, and I hit the road, once
again heading in the direction of home. And as I pull onto the highway , I
remember the last time I was sitting behind this wheel, just an hour or so
ago, feeling lonely , worried that I would be alone for the rest of my life.
Now I know how stupid I was, because tonight I’ll sit with my friends in
the living room and eat pizza, drink beer , and watch The Simpsons .
But that man — he will be alone tonight behind that blue door. He’ll be
alone tonight and tomorrow night and probably for many , many more
nights. I leave New Hampshire knowing that I know nothing about
loneliness, but also knowing that I never want to know about loneliness the
way that man understood it that day and will probably understand it for
many , many days thereafter .
CHAPTER SEVEN
Every Story Takes Only Five
Seconds to Tell (and Jurassic Park
Wasn’t a Movie about Dinosaurs)
There are many secrets to storytelling,  but there is one fundamental
truth above all others that must be understood before a storyteller can ever
be successful:
All great stories — regardless of length or depth or tone — tell the story
of a five-second moment in a person’ s life.
Got that?
Let me say it again: Every great story ever told is essentially about a
five-second mom ent in the life of a human being, and the purpose of the
story is to bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible.
I know this sounds a little ridiculous, but it’s absolutely true. Also,
rejoice! This truth — once understood and embraced — makes the
storyteller ’s job much easier .
These five-second moments are the moments in your life when
something funda mentally chang es forever . You fall in love. You fall out of
love. You discover something new about yourself or another person. Your
opinion on a subject dramatically changes. You find forgiveness. You reach
acceptance. You sink into despair. You grudgingly resign. You’re drowned
in regret. You make a life-altering decision. Choose a new path.
Accomplish something great. Fail spectacularly .
These are the moments that make great stories. They are the moments
that we seek when doing our Homework for Life. They are often small and
sudden and powerful. These are the best stories. They are the only stories
worth telling.
In “Char ity Thief,” my five-second moment comes when I realize that I
know nothing about loneliness, and more importantly , I never want to know
loneliness in the way that man in New Hampshire knew it on that day. In
the story , that moment happens  when he tells me that his wife, Lisa, has
died of cancer and that his childr en haven’ t returned home in more than five
years. I can still remember that moment as if it were yesterday . As he spoke
those words to me on that tiny porch, I felt my heart sink. All the strength in
my body left me. At that moment I was sure that I was the worst person on
the planet. It was the moment when I understood how truly stupid, self-
absorbed, and selfcentered I was.
That is the purpose of my story . I’m trying to tell my audience that there
was a time in my life when I felt alone and lost, thinking that I was facing a
lifetime of solitude, only to disco ver how foolish and blind I was to feel that
way. The rest of the story is crafted to serve that singular mom ent in time
and only that moment. Anythin g in the story that doesn’ t help bring that
moment to the greatest clarity possible is marginalized, shaded,  or removed
entirely . Anything that helps bring clarity to that moment is strengthened
and highlighted.
We’ll talk about lies of omissio n in a coming chapter , and you will see
how much I have left out of that story for the sake of my five-second
moment. You’ll see how much I have left on the cutting-room floor to bring
my five-second moment to the greatest clarity possible.
Understanding that stories are about tiny moments is the bedrock upon
which all storytelling is built, and yet this is what people fail to understand
most when thinking about a story . Instead they believe that if something
interesting or incredible or unbelievable has happened to them, they have a
great story to tell. Not true.
Think about the story that I mentioned in chapter 3 about my secret
childhood hung er. In that story , my wife tells me she knows that I was
hungry as a boy. She has uncov ered my lifelong secret. The full version of
that story runs about seven minutes (and can be seen on the “Storyworthy
the Book” YouTube channel), but it all boils down to that singu lar moment
at a dining-room table with my wife. Everything else I chose to include in
the story only serves to bring that moment to the greatest possible clarity .
In the complete version, I describe the food insecurity that I experienced
so often as a boy. I make you laugh when I tell about all the clever and
bizarre ways that I managed to find food for my siblings and myself. I
introduce you to my wife and kids. I talk about my marriage. I show you
my unending frustration over Charlie’ s throwing food. All of this seeks to
bring you as close to seeing and experiencing that five-second moment with
as much clarity as possible. I want you to understand its weig ht. Feel its
power . I want you to feel as if you are sitting at that table with us. If I’m
good, you may even feel something akin to what I felt in that moment.
It’s a story that makes people laugh and weep. It’s one of my most-
requested stories, and yet the moment is tiny. A few words spoken by a wife
to a husband at the dinner table. A moment that would possibly  have been
forgotten if I hadn’t been doing my Homework for Life. Yet it was one of
the most important moments of my life. It’s the moment I realized that my
wife knows my heart better than I do. I’m so grateful that I was able to see
it for what it was.
Many times storytellers fail to understand the importance of these five-
second moments. They see the big when they should be looking for the
small. They come to me and say, “I went to Tanzania last summer . I want to
tell that story onstage.”
My answ er is always the same: No. Visiting Tanzania is not a story .
Your ability to travel the world does not mean that you can tell a good story
or even have a good story to tell. But if something happened in Tanzania
that altered you in some deep and fundamental way, then you might have a
story . If you experienced a five-second moment in Tanzania, you might
have something. Think of it this way: If we remove T anzania from the story ,
do you still have a story worth telling?
If the answer is no, then you probably don’t have a story . If the answer
is yes, you might have something I want to hear .
A storyt eller and friend named Christina O’Sullivan tells a story about
her trip to Laos in her early twenties. She climbs a mountain and discovers
a one-room schoolhouse in a monastery at the summit. Insid e are thirty
boys and one girl, along with their teacher , who is a man. She’s invited to
stay and visit. She meets children more invested in their education than she
has ever been. She learns why there is only one little girl in the classroom.
In doing so, she discovers something fundamental about herself that
changes her outlook on life forever .
This is a great story , because if we remove Laos completely , Christina
still has a story to tell. It does not rely on an exotic locale or unusual food. It
doesn’ t depend upon an audience’ s interest in a foreign culture . The story
hinges upon Christina’ s five-sec ond moment in that school, and that school
could have been anywhere. It could have been in her hometown.
Years ago I sat on a panel of Moth storytellers and producers, listening
to storytellers pitch their stories  as part of The Moth’ s book tour for their
first collection. A man told us about a time in his childhood when he drove
his father ’s truck through the garage and into a swimming pool. It was a
story filled with excitement, suspense, and humor . He pitched it well. When
he finished, one of the produce rs asked the man what that story meant to
him. “How did it change your life?”
The man explained that whenever he’s sitting on a barstool or eating
dinner with friends, he knows that he has a story that can make people
laugh.
“Yes,” the producer said. “But did the experience fundamentally change
you in some way?”
“Yes,” the man said. “I always have a good story to tell. Something to
make people laugh. I love that.”
The producer explained that this man had more of a romp than a story .
A romp is an entertaining and amusing anecdote — often longer than you
might imagine an anecdote to be — but not something that will move an
audience emotionally . There was no resonance to his story . No lasting
effect. Nothing for the audience  to connect to. It was fun and exciting and
surprising, but it was unlikely to remain in the hearts of the audience in the
way a good story can. He had no five-second moment, so the story could
never be great.
These five-secon d moments can also be found in film and literat ure. My
favorite exampl e (and one I will refer to again and again in this book, so
you should probably go and watch the film) is the original Jurassic Park ,
written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp and directed by Steven
Spielber g. That movie was an enormous success, and most people assumed
that it was becau se the dinosaurs had been rendered by computer -generated
imagery and looked truly lifelike for the first time in Hollywood history .
Nope.
In fact Jurassic Park  is not a movie about dinosaurs at all. Crichton,
Koepp, and Spielber g use the dinosaurs to entertain and excite their
audience, raising  the stakes and building suspense (more on this later), but
the dinosaurs are not at the heart of the story . The five-second moment in
that movie has nothing to do with dinosaurs at all.
Jurassic Park  is a movie abou t a paleontologist named Alan Grant, who
is in love with a paleobotanist named Ellie Sattler . Grant and Sattler are a
couple, but they are not married. It appears that the primary sticking point
in their relation ship is Grant’ s unwillingness to entertain the thought of
having kids. In fact, he does not like children at all, much to Sattler ’s
disappointment. He considers them noisy , time-consuming, boring, and
expensive. He says that they smell. In one of the first scenes of the film, he
explains to a small boy about how a dinosaur might eviscerate him, using a
fossilized dinosaur claw to demonstrate.
Over the course of the movie, Grant finds himself thrust into the
company of two children, and ultimately he and these two kids must survive
Jurassic Park on their own. Grant risks his life repeatedly to save these
children, and as he gets to know them, he discovers a surprising affection
for each one. The boy, Tim, is adventurous and bumbling, and he loves
dinosaurs as much as Grant himself. The girl, Lex, is an old soul. Mature
and wise. Skilled with technology . Surprisingly calm in the face of danger .
Grant slowly comes to unders tand that these children are not just
smelly , expensive pests. They are interesting and compelling human beings,
despite their youth and small stature.
The five-second  moment in the film happens when Grant and the two
children are perched in a tree, resting for the night. Grant has Tim and Lex
nestled in each arm as he talks to them about the plant-eating dinosaurs that
they’ve just fed by hand.
Here’ s how the original screenplay reads:
Satisfied, Tim settles in for the night. Grant shifts too, getting
comfortable, but something in his pocket pinches him. He winces
and digs it out. It’s the velociraptor claw he unearthed so long ago in
Montana. Yesterday , actually . He looks at it, thinking a million
thoughts, staring at this thing that used to be so priceless.
LEX What are you gonna do now if you don’t have to dig up
dinosaur bones any more?
GRANT I guess we’ll just have to evolve too.
TIM What do you call a blind dinosaur?
GRANT I don’ t know . What do you call a blind dinosaur?
TIM A Do-you-think -he-saurus. What do you call a blind
dinosaur ’s dog?
GRANT You got me.
TIM A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
Grant laughs. Both kids finally close their eyes, but after a mom ent,
Lex pops hers open again.
LEX What if the dinosaur comes back while we’re all
asleep?
GRANT I’ll stay awake.
LEX (skeptical) All night?
GRANT All night.
Grant lets the claw fall to the ground.
It’s important to remember that Grant used this same claw at the
beginning of the film to frighten the boy he didn’ t like. It’s a boy he thought
was smelly and stupid. Now he has let his fossilized claw go. Instead of
holding on to this precious bit of ancient dinosaur , Grant is now holding on
to childr en — one who made him laugh a moment ago and the other whom
he has comforted like a father . This is Grant’ s five-second moment. It’s the
most important moment of the film. It’s a moment of true transformation.
This is why he tells Lex that he will have to evolve too. The word evolve  is
important and purposeful. Grant has already evolved. He sees these children
as some thing new and wonderful. His genuine laughter at Tim’s joke, his
comforting assurances to Lex, and his release of the fossil are all designed
to signal this momentous chang e. These are the indicators of Grant’ s five-
second moment, and therefore form the climax of the story .
Grant likes children. In fact, he loves these two, and he could
presumably love others. As a result, he and Sattler will live happily ever
after.
This is the end of the movie. More must happen, but only because
Grant’ s story of transformation is set in an action-adventure film on an
island full of dinosaurs. As a result, there is unfinished business. Exciting
encounters with velociraptors and electric fences and walk-in coolers. But
the rest of the film only seeks to wrap things up.
How will they escape the island? Who will live and who will die
(though if you know anything about storytelling, you would have known
this right from the start)? How will our heroes conquer these impossible
odds?
But none of that is important to the story . In this tree, Alan Grant
changes his feelings about child ren. He likes them. Loves them,  even. Story
over.
Imagine if I asked you to join me for a movie about a middle-aged man
who must learn to appreciate and love children so he can secure his
relationship with the woman he loves. Would you be excite d about the
offer?
Probably not. But place that heartfelt, deeply resonant story on an island
full of dinosaurs, and your opinion may change. And you’ll probably leave
the theat er thinking that the movie was great. You’ll find it lingering in your
mind and heart longer than any dinosaur movie before or since. You’ll think
it was because of the action and suspense, and that might be some of it, but
deep in your bones, you’ll love the story because it wasn’ t abou t dinosaurs.
It was about transformation and love.
Another example: Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first (and best) of
Spielber g’s Indiana Jones films. You might think it’s a story about a man
who is trying to find a religious artifact before the Nazis can get their hands
on it. Y ou might even think that it’ s a love story between Indy and Marion.
Nope. Raiders of the Lost Ark  is a story about a man who lacks faith. He
does not believe in God. Indiana Jones is all science and no spirituality .
Then, in his most desperate moment, he finds faith when he needs it most.
That is the real story of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It’s a story about a
scientist who finds God.
Don’ t believe me?
In the beginning  of the film, Indy makes it clear that he doesn’ t believe
in all of the supp osed religious power contained in the Ark of the Covenant.
He’s hunting for it because of its historical value and not because of its
potential to alter the course of World War II. When a military officer asks if
the Ark of the Covenant contain s the actual Ten Commandments, he says,
“Yes, the actual Ten Commandm ents. The original stone tablets that Moses
brought down from Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe  that sort of
thing.”
“If you believe that sort of thing.” It’ s clear that Indy does not.
When the officer asks Indy about the light emanating from the ark in a
picture that he shows them, Indy says: “Who knows . . . lightning . . . fire . .
. the power of God or something.”
Indy is dismissive. He is clearly not a believer . He regards lightning,
fire, and the power of God as one and the same. This is just a picture to
Indy. It doesn’ t represent the truth of the ark in any way. The tone of his
voice speaks of a lack of faith of any kind.
Yet at the end of the film, as the Nazis are about to open the ark for the
first time, Indy, who is now tied to a pole with Marion, closes his eyes and
tells Marion to do the same. He warns her to look away . If the ark was
merely an artifact, Indy the scientist would want nothing more than to see
what it contained. He’s spent the entire movie risking his life for this very
moment.
But this does not happen. Inste ad the scientist has become a believer .
Just as the ark is about to be opened, Indy finds faith in its power (and
therefore in God), and it’s his newfound faith that saves his and Marion’ s
lives. The Nazis  die, faces melting off their skulls, leaving only Indy and
Marion alive.
This is Indy’ s five-second moment. The moment he finds faith. The
moment he believes in the power of God.
This is how most big stories operate. At least the good ones. Big stories
contain these tiny, utterly human moments. We may be fooled by whips and
snakes and car chases, but if it’s a good story , our protagonist  is going to
experience something deep and meaningful that resonates with the
audience, even if the audience doesn’ t fully realize it.
Another one of my more popula r stories is one called “This Is Going to
Suck.” I will tell it in full in chapter 13 (and you can watch it on the
“Storyworthy the Book” Y ouTube channel), but essentially it’ s a story about
an even t that took place in my life when I was seventeen years old. On
December 23, 1988, I was involved in a head-on collision — 1976 Datsun
B210 versus Mercedes-Benz — that sent my head through the windshield
and embedded my legs in the underside of the dashboard. Minutes after the
accident, I was dead. I was lying on the side of the road without a pulse or
respiration. Paramedics administered CPR and brought me back to life. All
this sounds like the makings of a great story , but the story isn’t about the car
accident at all.
Like Jurassic Park , the real story isn’t about the big thing. In fact, when
people talk to me about the story , they rarely mention the car accident or my
near-death experience. Instead, they speak about my five-second moment,
when I find myself alone in the emer gency room two hours after the
accident, waiting for surgeons to operate on my ruined legs. Upon hearing
that I was in stable condition, my parents decide to check on the car before
checking on me, leaving me alone, frightened, and in terrible pain in the
corner of a cold, sterile emer gency room.
Except it turns out that I’m not alone, because my friends from
McDonald’ s find out about the accident and quickly fill the waiting room,
making the kind of noise that only a gang of teenagers can make. When
nurses realize that my parents aren’ t going to make it to the hospital before I
am rolled into surgery, they push my gurney to the other side of the
emer gency room , prop open the double doors to the waiting area, and allow
my frien ds to stand in the doorway to see me. The girls tell me that they
love me, the boys shout extremely inappropriate things to make me laugh,
and they chant my name as I am rolled down the hall to the operating room.
This was my five-second moment. It was the moment when I realized
that I had famil y after all. My friends were my family , and they remained
the only family I had and the only family I needed until I met my wife
fifteen years later . It might be the greatest five-second moment of my life.
Audiences cry when I describe the opening of those double doors. If I’m
not careful, I often tear up myse lf. But no one ever mentions the accident or
my death or my miraculous return to the land of the living. The moment
that they connect with is the moment those emer gency-room doors open
and I discover that I am not alone.
The accident itself is like the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park  or the car
chases and poisonous snakes in Raiders of the Lost Ark. It’s big and
compelling and remarkable, but it’s ultimately just a car accident. Without
my friends showing up in the emer gency room when I needed them most,
it’s just another car-crash story . Turn on the news at 11:00 PM and you’ll
see that they are a dime a dozen.
Without my friends arriving at my time of need, there is little for the
audience to connect to. But add my friends to the mix, and everything
changes. We’ve all felt alone at some point in our lives. We’ve all been let
down by loved ones, perhaps even by our parents. We’ve all had moments
when we are unexpectedly lifted from pain or despair by the kindness of a
friend. This is what people connect to. Few people will ever understand
what it’s like to crash throug h a windshield or awaken to paramedics
performing CPR  on your body . But feeling alone? Forgotten? Lost? We all
know that feeling.
Without Alan Grant’ s transformation from a man who despises children
to a man who loves them, Jurassic Park  is just another dinosaur movie in a
long line of dinosaur movies, simply with better special effects.  None of us
will ever know what it’s like to be chased by dinosaurs or electrified by
fences or trapped in a kitchen with velociraptors. But we all know what it’s
like to have something large and seemingly implacable standing between us
and love. We all know what it’s like to want something that the love of our
life does not. We all understand how difficult relationships can be and the
joy that comes with finally making them work.
If you think you have a story , ask yourself: Does it contain a five-
second moment? A moment of true transformation? Your five-second
moment may be difficult to find. You may have to dig for it. I was more
than three years into my storytelling career when I finally told “This Is
Going to Suck.”
Why? It took me that long to realize that the story shouldn’ t end in the
back of the ambulance. You might think that a story with a near-death
experience shou ld end with the near-death experience. For a long time I did.
How could that not be the most important moment? It’s hard to imagine that
a person’ s death and return to life might not be the most compelling part of
a story , but in my story , it’s not. It’s merely a necessary detail to get me to
the end. The real ending takes place in the emer gency room.
Besides, with near-death experie nces, you don’t realize that you’re dead
or dying until after the fact. In both of my experiences, when my heart
stopped beating and I stopped breathing, I had no idea that I had died. I was
only told much later about how close I had come to death.
If you’re not aware that you are dying, there is no moment of change or
transformation. It’s a simple matter of slipping from consciousness to
unconsciousness to death. Thus no five-second moment.
Similarly , it took me more than five years to tell the story of my arrest
and near-confession for a crime I didn’ t commit, because that story also
lacked a five-second moment. When I finally told that story in a Moth
GrandSLAM championship in 2016, my fellow storytellers came to me
after the show and said, “You were arrested and tried for a crime you didn’ t
commit, and it took you five years to tell the story?”
“Yes,” I said. “Until this week, I didn’ t know how to tell it.”
If possi ble, go listen to that story on the “Storyworthy the Book”
YouTube channel before reading on.
In that story , it wasn’t until I thought long and hard about that period of
my life that I realized that the interrogations, the police intim idation, my
near-decision to confess to the crime out of fear, my arrest, and my trial
were not the most important parts of that story . In the end, it’s a story about
standing in a mop sink in a dark closet in the basement of a police station,
trying to decide if I should confe ss to a crime I didn’ t commit. In a moment
of desperation, I ask a God I don’t believe in for help, and, a little like
Indiana Jones, I somehow receiv e an answer . It’s a story about a young man
taking one step closer to a faith that has eluded him for so long.
It’s a tiny moment in an enormous story filled with police officers,
interrogation rooms, handcuf fs, jail cells, and a courtroom trial, but what
people rightly remember about that story is my five-second moment in a
darkened closet when I was alone and calling out for help. And it took me
five years to find it.
So dig. Search. Hunt. Fight for the five-second moment. Allow yourself
to recall the entire event. Don’ t get hung up on the big moments, the
unbelievable circumstances, or the hilarious details. Seek out the moments
when you felt your heart move. When something changed forever, even if
that moment seems minuscule compared to the rest of the story .
That will be your five-second moment. Until you have it, you don’t
have a story .
When you find it, you’re ready to begin crafting your story .
STORY BREAK
This Book Is Going to Make Erin Barker Very
Angry
Sometime in the second year of my storytelling career , I’m sitting at the bar
with Erin Barker , a two-time Moth GrandSLAM champion, one of the
finest storytellers I know , and the host of the Story Collider , a storytelling
show featuring scientists and science-related themes. I’m performing in her
show tonight, telling a story about my high-school biology teacher .
“I heard  you won the slam last night,” she says, referencing a Moth
StorySLAM at The Bell House in Brooklyn the night before.
“I did,” I say. “But I almost lost to a stand-up. He was funny as hell but
just didn’ t have enough story . But he came close. If I had five or ten
minutes with him, I could turn him into a really good storyteller .”
Erin grabs me by the wrist and pulls me in close. “Don’ t you ever give
away our secrets.”
I loved Erin’ s reaction. When it comes to story slams, I am
exceptionally competitive. I want to win every time. For a while, this made
me feel like the biggest jerk in town. But it turns out that most of my
favorite storytel lers, Erin included, are just as competitive as I am when it
comes to competitive storytel ling. We want to win. We want to be
recognized as the best.
For the first four years of my storytelling career , my sights were set on
storyteller extra ordinaire Adam Wade, who had won a then-record twenty
Moth StorySLAMs before retiring from the slam circuit.
My win total at the time of this writing is thirty-four . I’m not sure if this
is a record. The Moth now hosts StorySLAMs in more than two dozen
cities, so there’ s no telling if or where someone is racking up as many wins
as me. But I like to think it’ s a record.
In fairness, the winning has also helped me quite a bit. It was winning
so often at The Moth that first got me recognized by producers, directors,
and the people who wanted to learn this craft from me. It’s part of the
reason that I am able to travel  around the country and the world telling
stories. It probably helped me land this book contract.
But unlike in many other competitions, storytellers root for their fellow
storytellers to succeed. We neve r wish misfortune on other storytellers. We
honestly want to see them perform well. Unlike baseball, where  I hoped the
opposing batter would strike out, or in football, where I would wish for a
fumble, or even in poker , when I am pleased when an opponent draws a bad
hand, I never want my fellow competitors to freeze up, fall apart, or tell
something cringeworthy . I want them to do their best. I just want to do
slightly better .
Erin let me know that night that I was not alone in my zeal to win. In
fact, when she beat me in my first GrandSLAM, she was the only woman in
the show . When she was name d the winner , she turned to her nine male
competitors and said, “Suck it, boys.” The perfect response.
I wonder what Erin will think of this book. I’m giving away our secrets
— or at least mine — in a big way .
CHAPTER EIGHT
Finding Your Beginning (I’m Also
About to Forever Ruin Most
Movies and Many Books for You)
So you’ve got yourself a five-second moment  — a moment of
transformation or revelation or realization. This is good. You’re already a
better storyteller than most people in the world.
Truly. Tell a story about a real moment of meaning from your life — a
five-second moment — and people will want to hear more.
More good news. You’ve also found the end of your story . Your five-
second moment is the most important thing that you will say. It is the
purpose and pinnacle of your story . It’s the reason you opened your mouth
in the first place. Therefore it must come as close to the end of your story as
possible. Sometimes it will be the very last thing you say .
Knowing your ending is a good  thing. When I write fiction, I have no
idea where my story is going to end. As odd as it may sound, I have never
accurately predi cted how any of my novels were going to conclude, and
many novelists operate similarly . John Irving claims to always know his last
sentence before beginning a novel, but I’m not sure if I believe him. Even if
I do, he’s John Irving. For us common folk, writing is often the means to
the end. We discover the conclusions and resolutions through the process of
writing the book.
But when telling  true stories about our lives, we always start with the
ending, because  we’re not maki ng stuff up. We’re not hoping to invent the
perfect combination of action, description, and dialogue. We’re telling the
truth, so even if we’re not entirely sure of how to tell our endin g — which
combination of action, dialogue , and description will best capture that five-
second moment  — we know what happened. We know the who, what,
where, and when, and we probably know the why (thoug h that can
sometimes come later). We know what our five-second moment is, and
therefore that is where we begin the process of crafting our story . We start
at the end.
This is a beautiful thing, because knowing the ending will inform all the
choices that we must make as we craft the rest of the story . Ever ything must
serve our five-second moment, so knowing the ending — and starting the
process of crafting the story with the ending — is helpful beyond measure.
In fact the endin g simply involves the choice of words you will use. How
will you describe your five-se cond moment for the greatest emotional
effect?
The hard part is finding the beginning, because it involves choosing the
right moments from your life, and there is often a multitude of choices.
So how do you choose the right place to start a story? Simp le. Ask
yourself where your story ends. What is the meaning of your five-second
moment? Say it aloud.
In “Charity Thief,” I might say it like this: “I thought I was alone in this
world, facing a lifetime of lonel iness. Then I met a man who taught me that
I knew very little about loneliness and never wanted to know loneliness the
way that man knew it on that day and probably many , many days
thereafter .”
That’ s my five-second moment. That is what I’m trying to say to you as
simply as possib le. It’s not a good story on its own, but choose better words
to descr ibe the moment, prop it up with everything that comes before the
moment, and you have yourself a story .
Once you’ve distilled your five- second moment down to its essence, ask
yourself: What is the opposite of your five-second moment?
Simply put, the beginning of the story should be the opposite of the end.
Find the opposite of your transfo rmation, revelation, or realizati on, and this
is where  your story should start. This is what creates an arc in your story .
This is how a story shows change over time.
I was once this, but now I am this.
I once thought this, but now I think this.
I once felt this, but now I feel this.
Stories must reflect change of some kind. It need not always be positive
change, and the change need not be monumental. In fact, stories about
failure, embarrassment, and shame are fantastic. Stories about trying
desperately to achieve a goal and failing spectacularly are beloved. Even
when progress is made, the best stories often reflect incremental change.
Tiny steps forward. Glacial improvement. Audiences would much rather
hear about incremental, tenuous growth than about overnight success.
Regardless of whether your change is infinitesimal or profound, positive
or negative, your story must reflect change. You must begin and end your
story in entirely dif ferent states of being.
Change is key .
The story of how you’re an amazing person who did an amazing thing
and ended up in an amazing place is not a story . It’s a recipe for a
douchebag.
The story of how you’re a pathetic person who did a pathetic thing and
remained pathetic is also not a story . It’s a recipe for a sad sack.
You create the arc of a story  through the change that your story
ultimately describes. Starting in one place and landing in anoth er. Think of
it like air travel. An airplane takes off, flies through the sky, and lands in a
new place. Your story must do the same. The easiest, most effective way of
doing this is by ensuring that the beginning and the ending of your stories
are opposites or as close to opposites as possible. This is not the case in
every story that I tell, but it’ s true for most.
I was once hopeful, but now I am not.
I was once lost, but now I am found.
I was once happy , but now I am sad.
I was once uncertain, but now I know .
I was once angry , but now I am grateful.
I was once afraid, but now I am fearless.
I once believed, but now I don’ t.
This change is what makes stories satisfying. It’s how storytellers are
able to move an audience emotionally . The same holds true for most
movies. Imagine this setup for a romantic comedy:
We open on a young woman working in a cubicle at a large bank. She’s
typing away on her computer when the phone rings. It’s her boyfriend. He
works in the bank too, one floor above our protagonist.
“Listen,” he says. “Bad news. I’m breaking up with you. I’m moving to
Tanzania today . And I’m taking  your best friend, Jane, with me. We fell in
love while buying you a birthday present last week. Have a great life. Bye.”
Our protagonist hangs up the phone and stares at her computer screen in
disbelief. Her eyes well up with tears. Just then her boss appears over the
top of the cubic le. “Listen,” she says. “We’re downsizing. Bad loans. I’m
sorry . You’re fired.”
In the next scene, we see our protagonist standing on the sidewalk
outside the bank, looking lost. She’s holding one of those brown boxes that
we see in movies, though never in real life, filled with the trink ets from her
desk and the contents of her drawers. She’ s holding back tears.
We all know how this movie is going to end. Right?
Think of the opposite of what we just saw .
Our protagonist is going to have a new boyfriend at the end of the
movie, and he’s not going to be a banker . He’s going to be the opposite of a
banker:
A kinder garten teacher
A sculptor
A mechanic
An artisanal-pickle pickler
Our protagonist is also going to have a new job, and it’s not going to be
in a bank. She’s not going to move from Morgan Stanley to Merrill Lynch.
She’s going to begin working at the opposite of a bank.
She’s going to open a cupcake shop.
She’s going to write an advice column.
She’s going to cultivate and sell bonsai tr ees.
She’s going to teach yoga to cats.
She’s also going to find a new best friend, and her new friend won’ t be
anything like Jane, her former best friend.
It’ll be the old Jewish man she meets on a park bench who teaches
her about managing the harsh r ealities of the world.
The eight-year -old boy she’ s babysitting who teaches her to enjoy
the little things in life.
The gay man who teaches her to finally live her authentic life.
If you know anything about storytelling, you can’t watch this opening
scene and not know how this movie is going to end. Unless we’re in the
midst of an indie or art-house film, this story can only end one way. This
doesn’ t mean you won’ t enjoy the movie. The path from beginning to end
will hopefully make you laugh. Surprise you. Touch your heart. But the end
should be clear . You might not know the specific details, but you should
know the gist of things — the general direction.
Simply ask yourself what the opposite of the first fifteen minutes of a
movie is, and you will almost always have your ending.
Remember the beginning of Jurassic Park ? Alan Grant terrifies a small,
round boy with a gruesome description of his death at the hands of a pack
of velociraptors . The dialogue between Grant and his love interest, Ellie
Sattler , then goes like this:
ELLIE Hey, Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid, you
could’ve pulled a gun on him, you know .
GRANT Yeah, I know . Kids. Y ou wanna have one of those?
ELLIE I don’t want that kid. A breed  of child, Dr. Grant,
could be intriguing! I mean, what’ s so wrong with
kids?
GRANT Ah, Ellie, look. They’re noisy , they’re messy , they’re
expensive.
ELLIE Cheap, cheap.
GRANT They smell.
ELLIE They do not smell!
GRANT Some of them smell.
If you don’t think Grant is going to fall in love with children by the end of
the movie, you’re not paying attention.
This is how movies work. Good ones, at least. Even the bad ones can be
fairly predictable in this way .
My friend Bengi asked me to go to the most recent film in the Jurassic
Park franchise, Jurassic W orld.
“I’ll go,” I said. “But listen. There are going to be two kids in the
movie, and neith er one will be eaten. There will be a male and female lead.
They won’t be romantically linked at the beginning, but they’ll clearly be in
love by the end of the movie.  They also won’ t be eaten. The owner of
whatever company owns the dinosaurs this time around is going to die. His
or her assistant will die too. The guy who plans bad things for the dinosaurs
— the corporate spy, military man, mad scientist — will also die. The man
who carries a gun the most will die. And in the end, one dinosaur will kill
the other dinosaur and save the day .”
As we leave the theater later that afternoon, Bengi turns to me and asks,
“Did you see that movie before today?”
I hadn’ t, but this is how Jurassic Park movies work. Even the bad ones,
which don’t involve Steven Spielber g. And if you watched the first fifteen
minutes of the film with a storyteller ’s eye, you would have known how the
movie was going to end too.
At one point during the film, the two aforementioned children —
brothers — are trapped in a large glass ball as the big, bad dinosaur tries to
bite down on it and break it open. The glass is cracking. The boys are
screaming. I stopped watching the scene for a moment to look around the
darkened theater . People were gripping their armrests in fear. Jaws were
locked. Nerves were frayed. Even Bengi was leaning forward. He was
tense. Frightened.
In that moment, I wanted to stand up and say, “We’re watching a
Jurassic Park movie, people! Do you really think those kids are going to get
eaten?”
But this is the magic of storytelling. Even when the ending is all but
certain, a good storyteller can grab the audience by the throat and make
them temporarily for get that they know damn well how this movie will end.
So the beginning is important. Finding that five-second moment in your
life is critical, of course, but in terms of actually crafting your story, where
you start your story is the most important decision you will make. The right
beginning creates a satisfying narrative arc that will cause peopl e to connect
to and remember your story . It will provide a clear , coherent path to the end.
It will serve as an enormous arrow that will point both you and the audience
in the right direction.
Sometimes the place to begin is convenient and easy to find. Sometimes
not.
In “Char ity Thief,” for example, my story ends with the realization that
I know nothing about loneliness . Once I found that five-second moment, I
asked myself, what is the opposite of knowing nothing about loneliness?
The opposite of knowing nothing about loneliness is the belief that you
know something  about loneliness. That you understand loneliness in some
fundamental way. In the case of this story , the beginning was easy to find,
because it happened on the same day as my five-second moment. Early in
the story , when I find myself parked in the Citgo station, sitting behind the
wheel, I say:
I’m angry , but I’m also sad. I’m twenty years old. I’m a McDonald’ s
manager . I make $7.25 an hour, and I am the richest person I know .
My moth er is living on welfar e with my pregnant teenage sister . My
brother joined the army a year ago, and I haven’ t heard from him
since. My father disappear ed from my life ten years ago. The only
person I know who can help me, who even has a credit card or a car
that can make this hundr ed-mile trip to New Hampshir e, is my friend
Bengi, and he is off on some college weekend. I can’t get in touch
with him, because in 1991, when you want to call someone, you
need to make a phone ring on a wall, and you need to make that
phone ring at the moment the person you want to speak to is near
that phone, and you need the number for the phone to make it ring,
and all of that is impossible for me to get.
This was not the plan for my life. . . . I was not supposed to be
this alone this early in my life. You’re not supposed to be twenty
years old and have absolutely no one in your life to call for help. As
I sit there in my car, staring into that field of orange and yellow , I
see my futur e ahead of me. An endless series of moments just like
this one, when I need help but will have none.
This is the opposite of my ending. This is me, sitting in my car, thinking
about how alone I am in this world, doomed to a life of solitude. It’s how I
felt in that moment, as foolish as that may have been.
In realit y I had a bunch of friends waiting at home for me. I had The
Simpsons , beer, and laughter in my very near future. I was a long way from
experiencing the loneliness of that man on that day. I just didn’ t know it at
the time. I was sad and frightened and feeling sorry for myself.
Luckily , my beginning was already embedded within the narrative, less
than an hour from my five-second moment.
If only every beginning were this easy to find. More often, the
beginning is much harder to find because the opposite of your five-second
moment does not happen on the same day or even in the same week as any
possible beginning.
For example, think back on the story of my wife’ s discovery that I was
hungry as a child. Finding the beginning of that story was challenging. I
knew the five-se cond moment of the story was the moment at the dining-
room table when my wife reveals that she knows my secret — I was hungry
as a boy — and probably knows me better than anyone ever in my life.
So I ask myself: What is the opposite of someone uncoveri ng your
secret?
The opposite of someone uncovering a secret, I decided, is the creation
of that secret. The initial decision to keep something secret. For me, this
meant dipping back into my childhood for moments of hunger and shame,
so that I could show my audience how and why I decided to keep my
childhood hunger a secret. I had plenty of moments to choose from. Too
many , in fact. Herein lies the challenge:
Which moment works best? Which of the dozens of anecdotes from my
childhood shoul d I use? If you’re a good storyteller , who believes that these
choices matter a lot (and they do), it’ s not an easy decision. I want to choose
the anecdotes that serve my story best. They need to show a variety of
contexts in which hunger and shame ruled my life. Ideally , at least one will
be funny and one will be heartrending. I’d like them to take place in a
variety of settings. I’d love for at least one to echo something at the end of
my story .
When we search our past for the beginnings of our stories — which
storytellers do quite often — we have a mountain of material from which to
choose. Less effective storytelle rs latch onto the first thing that comes to
mind rather than making a list of anecdotes, analyzing them for content,
tone, the potential for humor , and connectivity to the story before deciding.
I also believe that great storytellers know this: The first idea is rarely the
best idea. It may be the most convenient idea. The easiest to remember . The
one you personally like the most. But rarely is the first idea the one that I
choose. First ideas are for the lazy . The complacent. The easily satisfied.
I fight for my beginnings. I struggle to find the correct entry point to a
story , and I believe that every story has a perfect entry point. The ideal
place to start. More than half of the time I spend crafting stories is spent
searching for the right beginning. Once I’ve found it, the rest of the story
often flows easily. The correct beginning makes the rest of the choices seem
much more obvious.
I also try to start my story as close to the end as possible (a rule Kurt
Vonnegut follow ed when writing short stories). I want my stories to be as
temporally limited as possible. I strive for simplicity at all times. By
starting as close to the end as possible, we shorten our stories . We avoid
unnecessary setup. W e eliminate superfluous details.
In “Charity Thief,” I begin with the disintegration of my right front tire.
It’s the inciting incident that leads to all my trouble. But in an earlier ,
unfinished versi on of the story , I started the story with my booty call to
New Hampshire because it was an amusing encounter . The girl with whom
I spent the weekend lived in a two-room loft above a garage and slept in a
closet just large enough for a twin mattress. She called this space the Bat
Cave and had decorated it with twinkle lights and silken scarves. There was
a lot of humor to be wrung out of that arrangement.
The girl was also an interesting character . She was five years older than
I and worldlier than I will ever be. I had met her a year earlier while on
vacation. I waved to her car as she drove by. She pulled over and asked
Bengi and me if we wanted to hang out with her and her friend.
We did. Bengi’ s date with the friend didn’ t go anywhere, but I ended up
ditching my friends for the rest of the week and sleeping in the Bat Cave.
The stories that resulted from a simple wave of my hand are both
surprising and hilarious, but in the end, they were all left on the cutting-
room floor, both because they did not serve the story well and because I
wanted to start as close to the end as possible.
The tire, I decid ed, was the closest possible starting point to the end.
The audience needs to know why I am stuck in New Hampshire without
any money . The tire is the reason.
This process is not uncommon  for me. I often start my story in one
place and end up working my way closer and closer to the end as I revise.
The best example of this is a story I tell about arriving in Boca Raton,
Florida, with Elysha, who was my fiancée at the time. We realized upon
arrival that neither one of us had a valid driver ’s license (both had expired
the month befor e), so we could n’t rent a car from our prearranged rental
company .
There were four other rental counters lining the wall, so we went from
counter to counter , begging customer -service representatives at each to rent
us a car. After three emphatic rejections, we came to our last chance, an
Alamo counter manned by a young man in a Philadelphia Eagles jersey . I
sensed an opportunity . Wanting to be the kind of guy who can take care of
his woman, I told Elysha to hang back and let me handle this. “I’m getting
you a car ,” I said with all the bravado that I could muster .
This was important to me, because I’m not a real man. I can’t build or
repair a thing. I can’t assemble children’ s toys or construct one of my son’s
LEGO sets. IKEA directions might as well be in Swedish for me. I have a
hard time hammering a nail into a wall.
But I have friends who built their own houses. Restored their own cars.
Chop their own firewood. These  are men who can lift their entire house off
the foundation to repair the main beam. I can do none of these things. I
don’t even really know what a main beam is. My hands do not build or
repair , they purchase and replac e. As a result, I often feel like less than a
man in many contexts.
This was my opportunity to step up and deliver . To show Elysha that I
was a man who could get things  done. That she was marrying someone who
could take care of her .
When I started crafting the story , I began in the airport in Connecticut,
waiting to board the plane. It made sense. Begin the story at the start of our
journey .
Then I moved the beginning of the story onto the plane just before
takeof f. Why include the airport terminal in Connecticut? Fewer locations
in a story always makes things simpler and easier to digest for an audience.
Then I moved the beginning of the story into the sky between Hartford
and Boca Raton . Why include takeof f in the story when the actual plane
ride is irrelevant?
Wait. If the actual plane ride is irrelevant, why not eliminate the plane
altogether? Why  not begin the story as we disembark the plane and enter
the Boca Raton airport?
Wait again. Why not start my story while we were standing in line at
Enterprise Rent-A-Car? Why not begin the story a few feet from where it
will end? This is where the story really takes place.
Through this revision process, I managed to move the beginning of my
story about twelve hundred miles in distance and five hours in time. I also
eliminated two airport terminals and an airplane in the process. In the end,
the story takes place in one place: the building adjacent to the Boca Raton
airport where cars are rented to travelers.
I started as close to the end as possible.
Simplifying also helps storytellers tell their stories better . When time
and space is limited, it’s easier to remember your story . Easier to master
your transitions,  and easier to remember those favorite lines that you don’t
want to forget. But simplificati on is even more important because of the
difference between oral storytelling and written storytelling.
A written story is like a lake. Readers can step in and out of the water at
their leisure, and the water always remains the same. This stillness and
permanence allow for pausing, rereading, contemplation, and the use of
outside sources to help with meaning. It also allows the reader to control the
speed at which the story is received.
An oral story is like a river. It is a constantly flowing torrent of words.
When listeners need to step outside of the river to ponder a detail, wonder
about something that confuses them, or attempt to make meaning, the river
continues to flow. When the listener finally steps back into the river, he or
she is behind. The water that has flowed by will never be seen again, and as
a result, the listener is constantly chasing the story , trying to catch up.
To keep your listener from stepping out of your river of words to make
meaning, simplification is essential. Starting as close to the end as possible
helps to make this happen. Sometimes the closest place to start is thirty
years before your five-second moment. If that’s the case, so be it. But when
that beginning can be pushed  closer to the five-second moment, your
audience will be the better for it.
Movies operate similarly . Think about Steven Soderber gh’s Ocean’ s
Eleven franchise. In each of these movies, a group of likable thieves gather
in Las Vegas to rob a world-clas s casino of hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the real world, a heist like this would take months or even years to plan,
but that would never make for a satisfying story . Instead, Soderber gh has
these professional thieves plan their caper over the course of a few days.
This is a ridiculo us way to plan a robbery . But compressing the action into a
smaller amount of time makes the story more exciting. It intensifies the
action and emotion. It increases the likelihood of problems.
It also simplifies the story . Watching career criminals plan a heist over
the course of six months would be tedious, complicated, and monotonous. It
would be easy for Soderber gh to lose the attention and focus of his
audience. But when he jams all of that action into a few days, the story is
simplified to an enormous degree. Soderber gh starts his stories as close to
the ending as possible. He gets it.
Standing in front of the Alamo counter , I turn to Elysha. “Wait here,” I say
with as much bravado as I can muster . “I’m renting us a car.” As I approach
the coun ter and the man standin g behind it, the fact that this is an Alamo
counter is not lost on me.
My own personal Alamo. My final stand. My last chance for glory .
As I approach, I consider prete nding to be a Philadelphia Eagles fan.
They have just played my beloved New England Patriots in the Super Bowl
the month before (and lost), so I know enough about the Eagles to convince
the man behind the counter that I support his team. Perhaps we can find
common ground. I envision us bonding over our mutual love of a team that
he obviously loves, and I am more than willing to love for the next ten
minutes. I’ll talk about my admiration for Brian W estbrook, a shifty running
back who has hands as soft as clay, and I’ll rail against the much-despised
owner of the team and his inability to leave the football to the coaching
staff.
I’m nearly set on this idea when he says, “Hi, can I help you?” and I
instinctively revert to truthfulness and authenticity .
I had yet to stand on a stage and tell a story at that point in my life, but
even back then, I thought that authenticity was the best way to appeal to
people and to move them emotionally .
“Sorry about the Super Bowl,” I say , pointing at his jersey . He’ s wearing
number 5, of course. Donovan McNabb, the Eagles’ quarterback. “I’m a
Patriots fan, and I’ve got to tell you, we were terrified about facing
McNabb. He was the last quarterback we wanted to see in the Super Bowl.”
“Yeah,” Eagles Fan says, dejected. “That was a lousy day for Eagles
fans.”
“If only they could give the guy a little help,” I say. “Sometimes that’s
all a guy like McNabb needs is a little help. Someone to stand by him.”
“Exactly!” he says, suddenly perking up. “Why can’t they get him a no-
drama receiver to catch the damn ball?”
“And maybe a couple more guys on the offensive line for some
protection,” I add.
“Yes,” he says, almost pleading.
I unders tand his pain. I watched the Patriots lose the Super Bowl in both
1986 and 1997 before they finally broke through with their first Super Bowl
victory in 2001.
I was a fourteen-year -old boy in ’86, watching the game in the living
room of my childhood home. I wept as the Bears ran “Refrige rator” Perry
into the end zone to make the score 44–3.
In ’97, I was watching the game in the home of close friends. When
Green Bay wide receiver Desmond Howard ran back the second-half
kickof f for a touchdown, I threw my shoe through their living-room wall —
directly above the television — in a mindless act of rage. Watching your
team lose the Super Bowl is the worst.
We talk some more about the game. Debate the effectivenes s of the
Eagles’ much-maligned head coach, Andy Reid. Commiserate over the
impossibly talen ted yet equally annoying receiver Terrell Owens . A Patriots
fan and an Eagles fan — bitter opponents just two weeks ago — find
common ground  by talking about the big game. “A little help might have
changed everything,” I say .
Then we get down to business. I tell Eagles Fan that I need a car for the
week, and as I start to complet e the paperwork, he examines my driver ’s
license. “Oh,” he says, looking up. “I can’t rent a car to you. Your license is
expired.”
I feign surprise.  Then disbelief. Then disappointment. I try to channel
the sadness and distress of the 1986 version of me following  the Super
Bowl. I drop my head. I sigh deeply .
Then I look up. I ask him to look over at Elysha. “See that girl over
there? She’s my fiancée. She’s agreed to marry me, but I keep screwing up.
I’m holding on by a thread. This might be my last chance.”
“Sorry , man,” Eagles Fan says, and he means it.
I wait a beat. My eyes return to my shoes. I sigh again. Then I look up. I
look into Eagles Fan’s eyes and say, “Listen, I could use some help here. I
can’t let this girl down. I’m always letting her down. You know , sometimes
that’s all a guy needs is a little help. Someone to stand by him. A no-drama
wide receiver .”
Eagles fan smiles. Nods. Then he rents me the car .
Elysha can’t believe it. Neither can I. I’m not the kind of guy who
makes things like this happen.
Here are a couple more practical tips for choosing an opening:
1. Try to start your story with forward movement whenever
possible.
Establish yourself as a person who is physically moving through space.
Opening with forward moveme nt creates instant momentum in a story . It
makes the audie nce feel that we’re already on our way, immersed in the
world you are moving us through. W e’re going somewhere important.
2. Don’ t start by setting expectations.
Listen to peopl e in the world tell you stories. Often they start with a
sentence like, “This is hilarious, ” or “You need to hear this,” or “You’re not
going to believe this.” This is always a mistake, for three reasons.
First, it establishes potentially unrealistic expectations. “Hilarious” is an
exceptionally high bar. “You’re not going to believe this” is probably an
impossible mark  to hit. Never start your story by setting expectations for it,
realistic or otherwise. No one wants a rubric or an introduction at the
beginning of a story . They simply want a story .
Second, starting your story with a thesis statement reduces your chances
of surprising your audience. When you tell me that the story is hilarious,
I’m already prim ed for humor . When you say, “You’re not going to believe
this,” I am prepared for the improbable. Surprise is a beautiful thing in a
story . Apart from vulnerability , it may be the most beautiful thing about
stories. Letting  your audience know that your story is hilarious or
improbable hinders your ability  to catch them off-guard and offer them a
surprise later on.
Third, these are simply not interesting ways to start a story . A thesis
statement, a prediction about the audience’ s response to the story , or a
summary of its theme or mood does not immediately draw us into the
story’ s time and place. We don’t feel transported to a new and interesting
locale. We don’t get the sense that we are traveling back in time. We feel
lectured to. W e feel cheated.
Start with the story , not with a summary of the story . There is no need to
describe the tone or tenor at the onset. Just start with story , and whenever
possible, open with movemen t. Forward progress. It’s a simple and
effective way of grabbing the listeners’ attention and focusing it somewhere
specific. It makes them feel that we’re already of f and running.
In “Charity Thief,” my opening  sentences tell you that I am hurtling
down a lonely stretch of New Hampshire highway , headed in the direction
of home.
In “This Is Going to Suck,” I’m walking out of a record store on a
December day , two days before Christmas, with a shopping bag in my hand.
Forward momentum. These stories are going somewhere. We are
already on the move. Jump aboard for the ride.
Pay atten tion to the opening scenes of movies. So many of them use this
strategy as well. W e open on the protagonist or someone similarly important
to the story . That person will be moving. Walking. Running. Driving.
Flying. Climbing. Fleeing. Falling. Swimming. Crawling. Diving.
Filmmakers want to immerse you into their world as quickly as possible.
They want you to forget the theater and the popcorn and the jackass who is
texting beside you. They want you to be absorbed by the story . They want
you to for get that you even exist for the duration of the film.
Star Wars: A New Hope  opens on two starships racing through
space.
Vertigo  opens with a man frantically climbing a ladder , pursued by a
police of ficer.
Raging Bull opens with a figure shadowboxing in a boxing ring as
flashbulbs pop of f.
The Dark Knight  begins with a bank robbery in progress.
Apocalypse Now  opens with helicopters setting fire to a jungle.
Raiders of the Lost Ark opens on Indy and his team marching
through the dark and forbidding jungle toward a mysterious
mountain.
Jurassic Park  opens with a cage containing a velociraptor moving
through trees toward a group of armed men.
Titanic  opens with a submarine’ s descent toward the wreckage of
the doomed ship.
Casablanca  opens with a narration and a visual of refugees escaping
from France to Casablanca during W orld W ar II.
Many movies open with simple overhead views passing over an ocean,
a citysca pe, or a mountain pass. Many movies based in New York City open
with an overhead approach of the island over water . This has nothing to do
with the film but allows the director to open with momentum. Forward
movement. W e’re headed somewhere important.
Here’ s the good news: If you stop reading right now, you’re already a better
storyteller than most. If you are telling a story about a five-seco nd moment
of your life — a moment of transformation, realization, or revelation —
you’re doing well.
If you’ve also found the right place to begin your story — a place that
represents the opposite of your five-second moment, and one as close to the
ending as possible — you’ve established a clear frame and arc in your story .
You’ve identifie d the direction your story is headed in, and you and your
audience probably have a good sense of where that may be. You are already
going to be well received by audiences big and small.
If you’re careful about choosi ng that opening scene — not simply
choosing the first thing that comes to mind but instead asking yourself what
the opening scene needs — and you open your story with story  and not any
form of unnecessary or qualifyi ng introduction, you are going to grab your
audience’ s attention right of f the bat.
Stop here and you’ll be better than most. T ruly.
But don’t stop, because all you have now is the beginning and ending of
your story . That middle part — the arc — needs to be filled. You have to
carry your audience from beginning to end, holding their attention,
captivating them, causing them to laugh and cry and wonder .
There are ways to do this too. Ways to keep your audience’ s attention
firmly in place. Let me show you how .
STORY BREAK
Thirteen Rules for an Effective (and Perhaps
Even Inspiring) Commencement Address
1.Don’ t compliment yourself. Don’t praise your accomplishments
in any way. It is not your day. Even if you’re delivering the
valedictory speech, it’s still not your day. It’s a day for every
person in your graduating class. Don’ t place your
accomplishments ahead of theirs. You’ve already been
recognized as valedictorian; that should be more than enough
credit for one day. Make the speech about something other than
the great things you have done.
2.Be self-deprecat ing, but only if it is real. Don’ t ever pretend to
be self-deprecating. Your audience will see right through you.
This is even worse than being self-congratulatory .
3.Don’ t ask rhetorical questions.  These questions always break
momentum and displace your authority as the speaker onto your
audience. Also, audience memb ers will sometimes answer these
questions and interrupt you, which is never good.
4.Offer one granular bit of wisdom, something that is both
applicable and memorable. Anyone can deliver a speech filled
with sweeping generalities. Most people are capable of offering
old chestnuts and choice proverbs. The great commencemen t
speakers manage to lodge a small, original, useful, and
memorable idea in the minds of the graduates. It’s the offer of
one final lesson — a bit of compelling wisdom and insight that
the graduates will remember long after they have tossed their
caps and moved into the greater world.
5.Don’ t cater any part of your speech to the parents of the
graduates. As much as they may think otherwise, this is not their
day either . This is a speech directed at the graduates.
6.Make your audience laugh.
7.Never mention the weather or the temperature. If it’s a beautiful
day, everyone knows it. If it’s not, reminding your audience
about the heat or rain is stupid. There is nothing more banal and
meaningless than talking about the weather .
8.Speak as if you were speaking to friends. Be yourself. If your
language sounds more formal than your normal speech, you
have failed.
9.Emotion is good. Be enthusiastic. Excited. Hopeful. Even angry
if needed. Anything but staid and somber . This is not a policy
speech or a lecture. It is an inspirational address.
10. If you plan on describing the world the graduates will be
entering, don’t. It’s ridiculous to assume that the world as you
see it resembles the world that this diverse group of people will
be entering. Your prognostications will most assuredly prove to
be wrong. These graduates’ paths will be multifarious. Some
will be moving on to higher levels of education. Others will be
hired for jobs that may not even exist yet. Others will join family
businesses, travel the world, launch their own companies, or
return home to care for aging parents. Telling these people what
the world will be like for them requires hubris on a monumental
scale.
11.Don’ t define terms by quoting the dictionary . “Webster ’s
Dictionary says”  are three words that should be banned from all
speeches and essays until the end of time.
12. Don’ t use a quote that you’ve heard someone use in a previous
commencement speech. Don’ t use a quote at all, if possible .
Instead, be quotable . Your job is not to recycle but to create
something new .
13. End your speech in less than the allotted time.
A note on #4, which is probably the most important of the rules:
In 2016 , humorist Mo Rocca delivered a commencement speech at
Sarah Lawrence College and provided one granular bit of wisdom that is
both applicable and memorable.
Some perspective: Your great-gr andpar ents — and some of you may
be lucky enough to have known them — survived the Great
Depr ession and defended freedom during World War II, defeating
Hitler and the forces of darkness, ensuring that their progeny could
also enjoy life, liberty , and the pursuit of happiness. There’s a very
good reason the women and men of that generation are known in
history as the Gr eatest Generation.
Well, I did some resear ch, and it turns out that the life
expectancy of that generation was just 54. Your life expectancy is
76. That means that you can take a deep breath, chill out — catch
up on  House of Cards and Narcos — and spend the next twenty-two
years figuring out what you want to do — and you could still end up
matching the achievements of the Gr eatest Generation.
This singular idea — that gradu ates today will live on average  twenty-
two years longer than those from the Greatest Generation — is a
tremendous bit of wisdom. Rocca uses this fact to encourage graduates to
relax and place less pressure on themselves to succeed immediately . He
encourages them  to take the time to explore the world. Try out many things.
Consider all their options. Stumble into opportunities. Rocca says:
Some of you may not know exactly what you want to do or who you
want to be. Your brain may be whiting out from too much possibility .
Or mayb e you’r e simply drawing a blank. You haven’ t found your
passion. W ell ther e’s no shame in that. Quite the opposite.
Rocca’ s bit of wisdom will remain with me for a long time. I’ve already
used it twice with people I serve as a life coach in order to remind them that
it’s never too late to start something new . We have more time than we think.
This is exactly what you want from a commencement speech: one final
lesson that graduates (and commencement-speech stalkers like me) can use.
CHAPTER NINE
Stakes: Five Ways to Keep Your
Story Compelling (and Why There
Are Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park)
There is a good reason  that hundreds of people atten d Moth Story-
SLAMs once a week in New York City (not to mention around  the world),
but only about fifteen or twenty of them put their names in the hat to tell a
story:
Stakes.
Public speaking of any kind provides a lot of stakes. As you probably
know , many people place public speaking ahead of death on their list of
greatest fears. Standing before three hundred strangers and saying anything
is incred ibly difficult. Sharing a story from your life — something that
expresses truth and vulnerability — is even more challenging.
But that’s not the end of it. A Moth StorySLAM is a competition. Your
story will be compared to nine other stories that night. You will be assigned
a numerical score based on your performance — a score for everyone to see
— and those scores will be posted on a sheet of paper that will hang all
night long as a reminder of your failure or success.
When you tell a story at a Moth StorySLAM, there is a record of the
event. It is neither ethereal nor for gettable. It is quantified and cataloged.
In other words, there are stakes, and for many people, those stakes are
rather high. It’s hard enough to speak in front of hundreds of strangers
without notes. Add a layer of public evaluation, and the barrier is too great.
Speak Up, the show that my wife and I produce in Connecticut, is not
competitive. It is a curated performance of stories, and storytellers are
rarely in short supply . We have a stable of regulars always willing to take
the stage, and rookie storytellers are taking our stage all the time.
Frankly , we often have more storytellers than we need. But if we added
a layer of compe tition to our show, I suspect that this would not be the case.
We would have far fewer storytellers volunteering to take the stage. The
pressure to perform well in our show is not nearly as high as at a Moth
StorySLAM. There is no score. There is no public accounting of a
storyteller ’s performance. If you don’t do well, we are on to the next story
before you know it. Stories told at a Speak Up event are ethereal and
impermanent.
Moth StorySLAMs are competit ive because competition adds a layer of
stakes to the show for the audience.
Who will win?
Who will lose?
Will you agr ee with the judge’ s scor es?
Will your favorite storyteller of the night be victorious?
Even if every story in the show is a flop (and I’ve never seen that happen),
there is a reason to stay to the end of a StorySLAM: you want to know who
the winner will be.
Stakes.
I’ve only been nervous perform ing twice in my life. I told a story for a
Moth Mainstage at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston in 2013. It’s a big theater ,
and it was my first Mainstage with The Moth, but I wasn’ t nervous until I
found out that tickets to the show were more than a hundred dollars each.
Given the amount of money that each audience member had paid, I
suddenly felt the pressure to perform exceptionally well.
Jimmy Fallon was also in the green room one floor below me, waiting
to perform after The Moth was finished. His presence didn’ t help.
I was also nervous on the night I told my robbery story for The Moth’ s
Mainstage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music two years later. But I will
wait till chapter 22  to tell about that.
In both cases, I was feeling the high stakes of performance. Simply
defined, stakes are the reason audiences listen and continue to listen to a
story . Stakes answer questions like:
•What does the storyteller want or need?
•What is at peril?
•What is the storyteller fighting for or against?
•What will happen next?
•How is this story going to turn out?
Stakes are the reason an audience wants to hear your next sentence. They
are the difference between a story that grabs the audience by the throat and
holds on tight and one that an audience can take or leave. Stakes are the
difference between someone telling you about their mother and someone
telling you about the time they wanted to disown their mother .
Stakes are the reason we ride roller-coasters. They are why we climb
trees and arm wrestle or race our friends across the backyard. Stakes are
why sports dominate our culture and why asking a girl on a date can be so
difficult.
Stakes are the Nazis and the snakes in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Darth
Vader and his storm troopers in Star Wars. The iceber g in Titanic . The
dinosaurs of Jurassic Park .
Stakes are the reason we listen to stories when video games and pizza
and sex exist in the world. We could be doing any one of these things, but
we listen to stories because we want to know what happens next. In the best
stories, we want to hear the next sentence. And the sentence after that. And
the sentence after that.
Just imagine if I asked a friend, “Would you like to go to a movi e where
a man who does not believe in God ultimately finds the faith required to
save himself and the woman he loves?”
The answer would probably be no. No, thank you. I don’t want to see
that movie.
Instead I say, “Do you want to go see Raiders of the Lost Ark? It’s a
movie about an archeologist-turned-hero who must battle Nazis, snakes,
booby traps, and evil scientists in order to save the world?”
The answer is more likely to be yes.
The Nazis and snakes are the stakes. They are the things that keep our
attention scene to scene. They are the reason we buy a ticket and popcorn
and give up two hours of our life.
Boring stories lack stakes, or their stakes are not high enough. Stories
that fail to hold your attention lack stakes. Stories that allow your mind to
wander lack stakes.
There are many ways to add new stakes or increase the existing stakes
in a story , but not all stories need to have stakes added or increased. Some
stories are naturally infused with stakes. Their content alone is enough to
grab an audience by the throat and never let go.
I tell a story about a time I was paid to be the stripper at the bachelorette
party in the crew  room of a McDonald’ s, much to the dismay of the bride-
to-be (and myself). This story does not require any additional stakes or
heightening of the ones already there. No tricks are needed. I don’t need to
craft ways of holding the audience’ s attention, because the audience is
constantly wondering what will happen next.
That story, entitl ed “Strip Club of My Own Making,” is availabl e on the
“Storyworthy the Book” Y ouTube channel.
But “Charity Thief” is a differen t kind of story . The ending of the story
is admit tedly compelling. Impersonating a charity worker to steal money
from homeowners on behalf of the charitable organization is unusual and
surprising (and perhaps appallin g) and packed with stakes, and the resulting
conversation with the man about his wife and his life is captivating.
But getting to that blue door isn’ t terribly exciting.
My tir e deflates and disintegrates.
I pur chase a new tir e.
I have no money left over for gas.
I feel alone.
I beg for gas.
I’m r efused.
Then I devise a new plan.
Not exactly the makings of a great story , but with the use of a few cleverly
deployed strateg ies, I make this introductory sequence far more entertaining
and compelling than it really is.
Specifically , I use five different strategies to infuse this story with
stakes. These strategies are both easy to apply and almost always ef fective.
I happen to use all five of the strategies in this story (one of the reasons
I use it as a model for teaching), but you should know that this might be the
only story where I make use of all five strategies. As I said, some stories,
like “Strip Club  of My Own Making,” are already loaded with stakes. But
others need some help to raise the stakes at specific moments, and this is
where these strategies can prove useful. I will explain each one here and
show you where I use them.
The Elephant
Every story must have an Elephant. The Elephant is the thing that everyone
in the room can see. It is large and obvious. It is a clear statement of the
need, the want, the problem, the peril, or the mystery . It signifies where the
story is headed, and it makes it clear to your audience that this is in fact a
story and not a simple musing on a subject.
Elephants are critical to the success of a story . Movies have trailers and
summaries that you can read on websites like Rotten Tomatoes to inform
you of the gist of the story . Your friend might see a movie and give you an
idea of what the film is about. You’re likely both informed about the film
and excited to see it when you enter the theater . Rarely do you go to a
movie theater and not know what the movie is about. You almost always
have a general sense of what is to come.
Storytellers don’t have the benefit of a trailer . When a storyteller begins
speaking, whether in a theater or a dining room or a conference room, the
audience often has no idea of what to expect. Are we in the midst of a
comedy? A drama? An action adventure? A romance? Something in
between? Is this story going to challenge our sensibilities? Make us cry?
Offend us? Inspire us?
The audience doesn’t know why they are listening to the story or what
is to come, so it’s easy to stop listening. If you don’t present a reason to
listen very early on, you risk losing their attention altogether .
The Elephant tells the audience what to expect. It gives them a reason to
listen, a reason to wonder . It infuses the story with instantaneous stakes.
The Elephant should appear as early in the story as possible. Ideally , it
should appear within the first minute, and if you can say it within the first
thirty seconds, even better .
The Elephant is the dif ference between these two beginnings of a story:
Version #1
My mother was the kind of woman whom everyone adored. The model of
decorum and civility . She served as PTO president and treasurer of the
ladies’ auxiliary . She was the only female umpire in our town’ s Little
League. She baked and knit and grew vegetables by the pound.
Version #2
I don’t care how perfect my mother was. When I was nine years old, I
wanted to disown her. Leave home and never return. Forget she ever
existed. My mother was the kind of woman whom everyone adored. The
model of decorum and civility . She served as PTO president and treasurer
of the ladies’ auxiliary . She was the only female umpire in our town’ s Little
League. She baked and knit and grew vegetables by the pound.
The first story offers a character sketch of the storyteller ’s mother . We have
no idea what kind of story we are listening to, so it’s easy for us to check
out at this point. Nothing is at stake. There is no wonder . We don’t need to
hear the next sentence.
The second story starts with an Elephant. It contains exactly the same
character descri ption, but it opens with a clear explanation of what to
expect.
“When I was nine years old, I wanted to disown her. Leave home and
never return. For get she ever existed.”
The audience has a good idea of the story being told, and it’s likely that
they will want to hear more. Now they have something to wonder about:
Why did this woman want to disown her mother at such an early
age?
Will things turn out okay in the end?
Was her mother to blame for these feelings of ill will, or will we
discover that the storyteller was the r eal pr oblem?
Three simple sentences at the start of the story change our perception
about everything that follows. The Elephant may strike you as a simple and
obvious techniq ue, but it’s not. Pay attention to the way that people tell
stories. More often than not, you will find yourself two or three minutes
into a story , unsure of where the story is going and why you should
continue to listen.
Is this tactic simple? Y es. Obvious? Unfortunately not.
Elephants can also change color . That is, the need, want, problem, peril,
or mystery stated in the beginning of the story can change along the way.
You may be offered one expecta tion only to have it pulled away in favor of
another .
Start with a gray Elephant. End with a pink one.
In “Cha rity Thief,” the Elephant that I present at the beginning of the
story is a simple one:
I’m stuck in New Hampshire with a flat tire and no spare.
The audience knows this almost immediately . It all happens within the
first two sentences of the story . At this point, the audience is probably
thinking that this is an escape story: How will Matt escape from New
Hampshire and return home without a spare tire or money?
Those are the stakes. The problem is clear . Now the audience has a
chance to guess. To predict. To wonder . Hopefully the audien ce wants to
know how it all turns out.
Eventually the Elephant in my story changes color . The story isn’t really
about escaping  New Hampshire at all. It’s really a story about
understanding the nature of loneliness. I change the color of the Elephant
halfway through  this story . I present the audience with one Elephant, but
then I paint it another color . I trick them. This is an excellent  storytelling
strategy: make your audience think they are on one path, and then when
they least expect it, show them  that they have been on a different path all
along.
Note that I’m not actually changing the path that the audience is on. It’s
the same path we’ve been walking since the start of the story . The audience
just didn’t realiz e that it’s a much deeper , more interesting path than first
expected.
Don’ t switch Elephants. Simply change the color .
Changing the Elephant’ s color provides an audience with one of the
greatest surprises that a storyteller has to offer. My wife has often said that
this is my preferred model for storytelling, and she’s right. I’m always most
excited about a story when I can change the color of the Elephant.
“The laugh laugh laugh cry formula,” she calls it.
The audience thinks they are in the midst of a hilarious caper , and then
they suddenly realize that this story is not what they expected.
This method of storytelling is especially effective when the end of your
story is heavy , emotional, sorrowful, or heartrending. To keep an entire
story from being filled with weig ht and emotion, I try to find a way to make
the beginning light and fun, hilarious and joyous. I present an Elephant that
is happy , adventurous, and amusing to contrast with the weight, the sadness,
and the solemnity at the end.
Start with a pink, polka-dotted Elephant and end with varying shades of
blue.
My story “The Promise” is a perfect example of this. It’s a story about
my lifelong relationship with my high-school sweetheart, Laura. The
Elephant that I present at the beginning of the story is simple: “Matt must
execute the perfect first kiss with his new girlfriend, who also happens to be
his first love.” Then I proceed to tell the audience how I fail miserably at
every attempt to kiss her. With each failed attempt, the audience becomes
more convinced that the story will culminate with our first kiss. But in truth
the story  is about a promise I make to Laura when we begin dating. It’s a
promise I describe at the beginning of the story . It’s a promise that I must
keep almost twenty-five years later . That is what the story is really about.
Striving for that first kiss helps the audience understand our relationship
better . It brings our love for each other into clear focus. But it’s a story
about far more than a simple first kiss. The beginning is funny and joyous.
The ending is sorrowful and tragic.
Another excelle nt example of this is “Lemonade Stand.” The Elephant
that I present at the beginning of the story is “Matt wants to earn a hundred
dollars at his roadside lemonade stand.”
The lemonade is quickly discar ded in favor of more profitabl e items:
my brother ’s Star W ars collection, my sister ’s Barbie doll wardrobe, and my
grandfather ’s barbecued chicken. The story starts out as a boy’s hilarious
and possibly unethical attempt to earn some cash, but the truth of the story ,
and the truth about why I need a hundred dollars, is much more.
You can listen to both stories on the “Storyworthy the Book” YouTube
channel. See if you can spot the moment when I change the Elephant’ s
color .
Filmmakers almost always present an Elephant at the beginning of their
movies. Even a film like Die Hard, which one might describe as “terrorists
take over a skyscraper in Los Angeles, and only Bruce Willis can save the
day” is much more. It’s actually  the story of a husband trying desperately to
get back to his wife and save their marriage. He flies across the country to
visit her for Christmas and convince her to return to New York and their
former life together , but terror ists interrupt the reunion, forcing Willis’s
character , John McClane, to fight a lot harder to get his wife back.
The filmmakers present us with this Elephant very early on. McClane is
carrying an unwieldy stuffed animal on the plane for his daughter , the kind
a parent  only buys to make up for lost time. McClane’ s wife asks her nanny
to make up the spare bed, “just in case,” making it clear that this husband
and wife are not together in the traditional sense of the word. McClane then
explains his situation to Ar gyle, the limo driver .
MCCLANE She had a good job. It turned into a great career .
ARGYLE That meant she had to move here.
MCCLANE You’re very fast, Ar gyle.
ARGYLE So, why didn’ t you come? Well? Why didn’ t you
come with her?
MCCLANE Because I’m a New York cop. I got a backlog of New
York scumbags I’m still trying to put behind bars. I
can’t just go that easy .
That’ s it. The Elephant. Yes, there will be terrorists and explosi ons and
lots and lots of glass, but in the end, it’s a story about a disconnected
husband and a wife. It’s no surprise at the end of the film when McClane
saves his wife’ s life by removing from her wrist the Rolex she had received
earlier from her boss for a job well done.
The wife’ s new job in Los Angeles is the reason that the couple is
divided. We learned that at the beginning of the story . At the end of the
story , her new job is no longer an obstacle. Removing the watch symbolizes
this unspoken reality .
And it all started with a stuffed animal, a spare room, and a
conversation with a limo driver before a shot was ever fired. It started with
an Elephant.
Backpacks
A Backpack is a strategy that increases the stakes of the story by increasing
the audience’ s anticipation about a coming event. It’s when a storyteller
loads up the audience with all the storyteller ’s hopes and fears in that
moment before moving the story forward. It’ s an attempt to do two things:
1.Make the audience wonder what will happen next.
2.Make your audience experience the same emotion, or something
like the same emotion, that the storyteller experienced in the
moment about to be described.
The first goal is fairly easy to achieve if a Backpack is used properly . If
you can accomplish the second goal, that is really something.
In “Charity Thief,” I stick a Backpack on my audience when I describe
my plan for begging for money before entering the gas station. I say:
So I make a plan. I’m going to beg for gas, because it’s 1991. Gas is
eighty-five cents  a gallon, so eight dollars is all I need to get me
home. I’ll offer my license, my wallet, everything in my car as
collateral in exchange for eight dollars’ worth of gas and the
promise that I will return and repay the money and more. Whatever
it takes.
So I r ehearse my pitch, take a deep br eath, and walk in.
At this point the audience is loaded with my hopes and dreams.  They know
the plan, so when the kid behind the counter refuses to give me gas for my
car, the audienc e experiences the same kind of disappointment that I felt
that day . They knew the plan. They wanted it to succeed.
When I tell this story onstage, I watch my audience carefully at the
moment when the kid behind the counter refuses my request. It’s always the
same. When the kid says no, shoulders slump. Chins dip to chests. The
audience looks frustrated. Angry . Some audibly sigh. They were hoping,
just as I was, that my problem would be solved. By putting a Backpack on
them, I allowed  my audience to enter the gas station with me, wondering
what would happen next. I turned my plan into their plan. They’re now
invested in the outcome.
These are stakes. The audience must hear the next sentence.
This is why heist movies like the Ocean’ s Eleven franchise explain
almost every part of the robbers’ plan before they ever make a move. If you
understand their plan to rob the casino, you can experience the same level
of frustr ation, worry, fear, and suspense that the characters feel when their
plans go awry . The filmmakers put the audience on Danny Ocean’s team.
They know the plan, so they feel as if they are a part of the heist
themselves.
You’ll see this in films consta ntly. A group of teens is trapped in a
haunted house. They devise an escape plan. Their plan fails. One of their
group disappears in the process. He is presumably dead. Then our heroes
regroup to make a new plan. Each time characters in a movie regroup and
make a new plan, the audience is given a new Backpack. This makes them
wonder what will happen next. It allows the audience to become
emotionally connected to the results of the characters’ plan, or, in the case
of storytelling, emotionally connected to you as the storyteller .
Backpacks are most effective when a plan does not work. If I had
described my plan for begging for gas, and then the plan worke d perfectly ,
there would have been no payo ff for the Backpack. The scene  would fall
flat. If I go through all the trouble of explaining my plan beforehand, and
then I say, “The kid agrees to lend me the gas,” the audience is oddly
unsatisfied. They are left wondering why I went through all of that
explanation only to find out that things turned out fine.
Similarly , if Danny Ocean’ s complex and clever plan for robbing the
casino goes of f without a hitch, you have a terrible movie.
It’s an odd thing: The audience wants characters (or storytellers) to
succeed, but they don’t really want characters to succeed. It’s struggle and
strife that make stories great. They want to see their characters ultimately
triumph, but they want suf fering first. They don’ t want anything to be easy .
Perfect plans executed perfectly  never make good stories. They  are the
stories told by narcissists, jackasses, and thin-skinned egotists.
Breadcrumbs
Storytellers use Breadcrumbs when we hint at a future event but only reveal
enough to keep the audience guessing.
In “Charity Thief,” I drop a Breadcrumb when I say:
But as I climb back into the car, I see my crumpled McDonald’ s
uniform on the backseat, and I suddenly have an idea.
During a worksh op, sometimes I’ll stop the story right there and ask my
students what they are thinking. Their responses are hilarious.
The most common response is “I thought you were going to find a
McDonald’ s and work at it for a few hours to earn the money you needed.”
“Yes,” I say. “Because this is how McDonald’ s restaurants work. You
can don a unifo rm and work in any restaurant at any time that you’d like,
and you’ll be paid in cash at the end of your self-determined shift.”
The second most common response is “I thought you’d sell your
uniform at a thrift shop.”
“Yes,” I say, “Thrift shops are always looking for used fast-food
uniforms. Also, how was I supp osed to locate a thrift store a hundred miles
from home with almost no gas in my car?”
I know these guesses seem silly, but who can blame the respo ndents?
The real answer is almost impossible to predict, and that’s why I love this
Breadcrumb. All I care about is that my audience is wondering what will
happen next. Even if they haven’ t made an actual prediction in their mind,
they are wonde ring: What will Matt do with that uniform? How is that
going to help him get the gas he needs to escape New Hampshire?
Stakes. The audience needs to hear the next sentence.
The trick is to choose the Breadcrumbs that create the most wonder in
the mind s of your audience without giving them enough to guess correctly .
Choose wisely . Breadcrumbs are particularly effective when the truly
unexpected is coming. I am about to impersonate a charity worker in order
to steal money from innocent homeowners. That is unexpected.  The perfect
moment to lay a Breadcrumb.
Hourglasses
There comes a time in many stories when you reached a moment (or the
moment) that the audience has been waiting for. Perhaps you have paved
the way to the moment with Breadcrumbs and Backpacks, or maybe you’ve
used none of these strategies because you’ve got yourself a stake-laden
story , and now you’re approaching the payof f. The sentence you’ve been
waiting to say . The sentence your audience has been waiting to hear .
This is the moment to use an Hourglass. It’s time to slow things down.
Grind them to a halt when possible. When you know the audience is
hanging on your every word, let them hang.  Drag out the wait as long as
possible.
In “Charity Thief,” that momen t occurs as I am knocking on that blue
door. The audience knows that I’m about to do something to attempt to
solve my problem. They know that a McDonald’ s uniform is involved (my
Breadcrumb), but they probably can’ t imagine what my solution might be.
They want to know . They need to know . So what do I do?
I stop the story cold. I bring everything to a halt. I start by describing
things that don’ t require a description. I say:
An hour later, I’m standing on the porch of a small, red-brick house
on a quiet, r esidential str eet. I’m knocking on a blue door .
I’m wearing my McDonald’ s manager ’s uniform.
We all know what a McDonald’ s uniform looks like. Everyo ne has seen
one, either in real life or on the multitude of McDonald’ s commercials that
plaster the television screen daily. Even if an audience membe r has never
seen one before, knowing what it looks like is irrelevant to the story . There
is no need to describe this uniform in any detail, yet I choose to describe it
anyway , in the greatest detail. It is the longest bit of description in the entire
story , and I’m describing the last thing in the word that needs to be
described. This is because I have my audience now. I own them. They
cannot wait for that blue door to open so the unknown can become known.
What the hell is Matt planning to do?
Why is he wearing his McDonald’ s uniform?
I want this moment to last as long as possible. I want to milk it for every
bit of suspense. I say:
Blue shirt. Blue pants. Blue tie. Gold name badge. I’m holding a
gray McDonald’ s briefcase with a big M engraved on the front like
a shield.
This story has come to a complete stop. Think about it: I say the word blue
in this passage three times.
I also use the word shield  intentionally . A shield is used in battle. I want
to hint at the possibility of danger . Violence. W ar. More stakes. Then I say:
I knock on that blue door again.
When the door opens, a man is standing in front of me. He looks
about fifty, but he might as well be five hundr ed. He’s one of these
guys who looks as if he has all the wisdom of the world wrappe d up
in him, and in that moment, I know that he knows that I’m about to
do something terrible.
That is a lot to say about a man whom I’ve seen for exactly three seconds.
That’ s a lot of assumptions. But once again, I’m grinding this story to a halt.
Making my audience wait for the sentence they want most.
I use the word terrible  intentionally too. It was a word chosen carefully .
I consid ered many alternatives. I wanted a word that would suggest many
things. I wanted a word that would cause the greatest wonder in my
audience’ s mind.
After much delib eration, I settled on terrible . I think  it’s perfect. Then I
say:
But it’s two o’clock on a Sunday afternoon. I’m standing on his
porch in a McDonald’ s uniform. It’s one of those moments when you
realize that the only way to get out of a terrible situation is to go
through with it. So I take another deep br eath and say . . .
All I’ve done here is summarize what has just happened. It’s unnecessary .
It’s redundant. Under any other circumstances, I would argue that this
section needs to be cut. But this is not any other circumstance. I have my
audience dying for the next sentence, and I know it. This unnece ssary bit of
summary slows things down and raises the tension even further. It’s the
final delay before the sentence that everyone is waiting for. The sentence
that will cause people to either laugh or groan (and your reaction says a lot
about you as a person).
“Hi, I’m Matt, and I’m collec ting money for Ronald McDonald
Childr en’s Charities.”
In addition to adding in superfluous detail and summary , I’ll slow my pace
as I approach this sentence. I will reduce my volume. I want the audience
on the edge of their seats, desperately awaiting those twelve words.
It’s the perfect time to use an Hour glass.
Stakes. The desire of an audience to hear the next sentence, made
greater by the deliberate slowing down of action and pace.
Find the moment in your story that everyone has been waiting for, then
flip that Hour glass and let the sand run.
Crystal Balls
The Crystal Ball is the easiest of the strategies to deploy , because you
already use Crystal Balls in everyday life. A Crystal Ball is a false
prediction made by a storyteller to cause the audience to wonder if the
prediction will prove to be true.
In “Charity Thief,” I say:
[The man] point s his finger at me and says, “You stay right there.”
Then he walks back into his house, and I know what he’s doing. He’s
calling the police, and they will come and arrest me for stealing
money fr om McDonald’ s.
This does not happen, of course, but when I present this very real
possibility , the audience wants to know if it will happen. By predicting my
future arrest, I’ve established wonder in their minds about a future event.
We use Crystal Balls in everyday life because we, as human beings, are
all prediction machines. We are constantly trying to anticipate the future, so
when telling stories, recounting those in-the-moment predictions is critical.
You might tell your significant other , “The boss called me into her
office this morn ing, and as I walked down the hall, I just knew  I had done
something wron g and was gettin g fired. This was it. The end of the road for
me. It was the longest walk of my life. When I stepped into her office, she
told me that I was being promoted.”
Or “I was sure that my boyfriend forgot my birthday again, but when I
got home, he had a surprise party waiting for me.”
Or “For the first four decades of my life, I thought brie was disgusting
simply because of the way it looked. But tonight I tried brie for the first
time, and I can’ t believe what I’ve been missing.”
That last one is real. It took me forty years to taste brie. I’m an idiot.
We spend our lives predicting our future. Anticipating what will come
next. Often these predictions about future events are incorrect, and quite
often they become part of the stories we tell. We want people to know what
we were thinking as well as what we were saying and doing.
In storytelling, deploy Crystal Balls strategically: Only when your
prediction seem s possible. Only when your guess is reasonable. And only
when your prediction presents an intriguing or exciting possibility .
The idea that the police might be coming to arrest me in “Charit y Thief”
meets these requirements well.
Remember , the best way to ensure that your story has stakes is to choose a
story that has stakes. Elephants, Backpacks, Breadcrumbs, Hour glasses, and
Crystal Balls will only get you so far. If your story is boring, it will always
be borin g. But if your story has some potentially boring parts — sections
that need to be told but simply aren’ t compelling — these strategies will
help a lot.
Every single one of the stories  I have told onstage has an Elephant.
They all begin with a clear sense of the want or need or peril or problem or
mystery . Sometimes that Elephant changes color , sometimes not.
Many of my stories only use an Elephant. When you’re taking your
clothes off in the crew room of a McDonald’ s or donning cardboard armor
to battle a vicious cat or riding your bike off a barn roof, you have all the
stakes you’ll ever need.
If you’re not sure about the level of stakes in your story , simply ask
yourself:
•Would the audience want to hear my next sentence?
•If I stopped speaking right now , would anyone care?
•Am I more compelling than video games and pizza and sex at
this moment?
If the answer to any of these questions is no, you need to raise the
stakes. Use these strategies to engage your audience and bring them to the
edge of their seat.
There are certainly other ways to raise the stakes in a story , but these
five strategies are easily learned and easily deployed. With a little practice,
these will get you far. In additio n to these five strategies, I want to mention
one more way to keep your audience’ s attention.
Humor
Humor doesn’ t actually add to or raise the stakes of a story . It doesn’ t give
your audience a reason to listen for the next sentence. It doesn’ t increase the
level of suspen se or peril or mystery . But it’s a way of keeping your
audience’ s atten tion through a section of your story that you think might be
less than compelling.
Chapter 16  will address the effective use of humor , but just know that in
the absence of possible stakes, humor can substitute for a time. But also
remember that the goal of a storyteller is not to tell a funny story . The goal
is to tell a story that moves an audience emotionally . That means  a story can
contain humor , but if it’s all funny , then the story operates on a single
emotional plane and is ultimately for gettable.
Humor will keep  your audience listening, but use it for this reason only
when you’re unable to raise the stakes in any other way .
Stakes are essen tial in a story . Stakes are the gears that make stories
work. If your story lacks stakes or lacks meaningful stakes, there is nothing
you can do to make that story great.
Humor is optional. Stakes are nonnegotiable.
STORY BREAK
Zombie Brother
My brother, Jeremy, went missing back in 2007. He quit his job, changed
his phon e number , moved. Disappeared without telling a soul. After a long
and extensive search, no sign of him could be found.
Jeremy frequently spent time in the South, photographing Civil War
battlefields, often on his own. As the years rolled by and we heard nothing
from him, I reached the conclusion that my brother was probably dead.
Through accident or misdeed, something terrible had happened to him. He
was gone forever .
I went from telling people that I didn’ t know where my brother was to
telling them that he had disappeared to explaining that Jeremy was
presumed dead.
In 2012, I was preparing to perform at the 92nd Street Y in New York
City. I was sitting in the café, nibbling on a bagel alongside my father -in-
law and my editor , when I felt a tap on my shoulder .
“Don’ t I know you?”
I turned.  It was Jeremy . Just minutes before I was to take the stage and
perform for hundreds of people, my dead brother had come back to life.
Our reunion was made possible by a woman who had read my first
novel and decided to learn more about me online. She found a blog post
explaining the presumed fate of my brother .
She knew Jerem y. A year earlier, she had been working for him. She
called Jeremy and told him that I’d been looking for him. During his
disappearance, many things had changed in my life. I had published my
first two novels and had begun  performing onstage. My daughter , Clara,
was born.
The woman knew that I was performing at the 92nd Street Y and
convinced Jeremy to attend the show and reconnect with me.
He did. We spent about fifteen minutes in the café, catching up as
quickly as possible.
Then I took the stage. Before telling my story , I explained to the
audience what had just happene d. I needed to say it aloud so I could move
on to my story . They were as shocked as I was. My father -in-law says it was
the only time in his life that he has seen me speechless.
I told a story onstage that night in which my brother played a role (of
course). When I was finished, I found Jeremy standing in the back of the
room. His first words to me were, “You messed up that story! You left out
the best part!”
He was right. I can’ t remember everything.
My brother and I have been in frequent contact ever since.
About a month after meeting in New York, Jeremy invited us over for
dinner at his apartment, about  an hour from my home. We invited the
woman who reconnected us as well. Jeremy cooked a meal identical to what
my mother would have cooked when we were children. We ate and laughed
and shared stories.
When Jeremy bent over to pick up Clara to hug her at the end of the
evening, I warned him that she would cry. Clara cried whenever anyone
except for Elysha or me picked her up.
She was silent as Jeremy held her in his arms. Smiling, even. It was a
damn miracle.
When my son, Charlie, was born later that year, Jeremy was the first
person I called from the delivery room.
You never know who you’re going to meet at a storytelling show .
CHAPTER TEN
The Five Permissible Lies of True
Storytelling
It’s time for me to come clean:  I lied to you.
“Charity Thief” is full of lies. You may argue by the end of this chapter
that they aren’ t really lies, but I like the word lie because it grabs people’ s
attention. I’m a storyteller . Words matter .
But yes, it’s true. They aren’ t exactly lies, but rather slight
manipulations of the truth. Alter ations in the fabric of reality . Shifts in time
and space.
But I’ll continue  to call them lies throughout this chapter , because three-
letter words are convenient to type, and again, lies get attention.  Alterations
in the fabric of reality  is the kind of wonky phrase used by a president who
is facing impeachment.
Three importan t caveats before we proceed with the five types of
permissible lies in storytelling:
Important Caveat #1
As story tellers, we only lie for the benefit of our audience. We never lie for
our own personal gain. We don’t manipulate the truth, alter the fabric of
reality , or shift time and space for our own benefit. We’re not in the
business of making ourselves  look better , appearing more noble, or
mitigating our shame or failure. We lie in our stories only when our
audience would want us to lie — only when the story is better for our doing
so.
Important Caveat #2
Memory is a slippery thing, and as storytellers, we must remember this.
Research sugge sts that every time you tell a story , it becomes less true.
Each time you remove a memory from the file cabinet of your mind and
play with it for a while, you are unconsciously making chang es, so when
you return that folder to the file cabinet, the memory is permanently altered.
We tell stories as well as we can remember them, but we must acknowledge
that this is probably inaccurate in many ways.
I tell a story about the night that my first child was conceived  entitled
“Sex with Corn.” It’s a story about my secret desire to avoid becoming a
parent because I grew up as the eldest of five, filling in the role of parent so
often because my parents were never present. As a boy, I felt perpetually
overwhelmed and forever alone. I never wanted to feel this way again.
But I loved my wife and agreed to at least one child so that she would
marry me, and after two years of marriage, the time had come to finally
make a baby . Thanks to the stupid internet and some baby-mak ing website,
Elysha knew the exact night when she was ovulating. Rather than a month-
long carpet bombing of my wife’ s uterus, I was relegated to a single,
surgical strike. Even the fun had been stolen from making a baby .
On that night when the internet told us to have sex, Elysha burned her
hand terribly on a pan while making dinner . A blistering second-degree
burn. As sympathetic as I was to her pain, I was also thinking,  “Great. No
sex tonight. Another month before I have to become a father .” A one-month
reprieve doesn’ t sound like much, but on that day, with fatherhood looming,
twenty-eight days of freedom felt enormous.
Later that night Elysha came to bed clutching a bag of frozen corn.
“Honey ,” I said. “No.”
“Yes,” she said. “Just make it quick.”
Not only had she given me an order that I was perfectly capable of
following, but it was the moment I realized for the first time that I wasn’ t
going to be overwhelmed and alone this time around. As a father, I would
have Elysha standing beside me, a woman willing to have sex with me
while clinging to frozen vegetables. If she could do that, she could do
anything.
Why do I tell you this? When I was first preparing this story , I thought I
was the one who had burned his hand. When Elysha overheard me
preparing this story , her reaction was loud and immediate. “What did you
say? Y ou didn’ t burn your hand! I did!”
I thought she was crazy . I was certain that I was one with the blistering
wound. We went back and forth for a while. Fortunately , I write a blog that
basically documents my life, so we were able to go back to that evening’ s
entry and discover that Elysha was right. She had burned her hand. This, of
course, made sense, since I almost never cook, and when I do, it’s eggs or
macaroni and cheese.
I also distinctly remember the moment of realization in our bedroom. “I
won’ t be alone when I’m a father . Elysha will be with me.” That makes no
sense if I was the one with the burned hand.
Still, I was sure that my hand had been burned. That is how I
remembered it.
Memory is a slippery thing. Our stories are true as we rememb er them,
but even someone like me, who remembers more of his life than most
people, doesn’ t remember accurately . We must accept this.
One of the things I often do when working on a story is contact the
people involved for pertinent details. My sister , Kelli, has a memory for our
childhood that rivals my own. She can tell you what she wore on the first
and last day of school from kinder garten through her senior year of high
school. She has been an enorm ous resource when recalling details, and
others have been as well. After  hearing me perform for the first time, my
brother ’s first comment to me was “Y ou for got the best part of that story!”
It was true. I added the part he mentioned, and the story is much better
for his reminder .
My point is this: We want to tell true stories of our lives, but no story is
entirely true. Intentionally or otherwise, our stories contain mistakes,
inaccuracies, slippages of memory . All I am asking you to do is to be
strategic in some of your inaccuracies, and only when it’s done for the
benefit of the audience. Okay?
Important Caveat #3
As story tellers, we never add something to a story that was not already
there. We can manipulate the story in ways I will explain, but never, ever do
we add something that did not already exist in the moment. We are not
fiction tellers. We are truth tellers. We may not tell the whole truth, and we
may manipulate that truth from time to time, but we start with a pile of facts
and figures, and we never add to that pile. It’s our job to take the raw
content of a story and craft it into something entertaining, compelling,
moving, and satisfying. Maki ng something up is cheating, and great
storytellers are not cheaters.
The Five Permissible Lies of Storytelling
Lie #1: Omission
Every story contains omissions.  If you were to tell every single thing in the
story , it would never end. We all omit elements from our stories, but great
storytellers do this strategically and for a variety of reasons.
Here are a few of the strategic omissions in “Charity Thief,” as well as
the reason for each omission.
Randy
I pick up a hitchhiker that day. His name is Randy , and he migh t be the
craziest person I’ve ever met. I pick him up in hopes he will trade gas
money for a ride, but he has no money .
“Why would I be hitchhiking if I had money?” he asked.
Randy is with me for much of the story . When I am standing  on the
porch as that man tells me about  his dead wife, Randy is standing across the
street, hiding behind a tree, wondering what the hell is going in.
I remove Randy from the story because if you know that he is behind
the tree as I speak to the man, then you are behind the tree with Randy
instead of on the porch with me. Randy is hilarious and bizarre  and would
make my story funnier and maybe even more entertaining, but he doesn’ t
help me get my audience on the porch with me and the widower . Randy
distracts. He does not serve my five-second moment, so he gets cut right
out.
People are the most frequently omitted aspects to stories: third wheels
and random strangers who distract audiences from the matter at hand. If a
person doesn’ t fill a role in your story , simply pretend that person wasn’ t
there.
My frien d Tom tells the story about a girl named Liz whom he admired
from afar in college for quite a while. One night he finally gets the courage
to ask her to dance, and they end up dancing the night away .
At the end of the evening, he asks to drive Liz home. She smiles and
agrees. On the way, they finally  have a chance to talk. Liz asks Tom what
he’s doing at school.
“I’m a junior ,” Tom says. “W orking on my education degree.”
“A junior?” Liz says. She sounds confused. “How old are you?”
“Twenty ,” Tom says. “Why?”
It turns out that Liz is twenty-seven. She works at the school. She’s just
spent the evenin g dancing with a student in front of her collea gues. She’s
embarrassed. She feels that she’s been tricked. She’s in a rage. She yells at
Tom for the remainder of the drive.
When they arrive at Liz’s apartment, she throws open the car door and
storms up the walk.
“Can I call you sometime?” T om shouts.
“I think you’re a little young for me!” Liz shouts back and marches to
her door .
Tom then tells the audience, “And when people ask how I met my wife,
that is the story I tell.” Great. Right?
One problem. There’ s a third person in the car. Tom is driving another
girl home too. She’s in the backseat. When Tom first told me the story , he
included the third wheel, and instead of a story about him and Liz, it
unintentionally becomes a story of a girl in an incredibly awkwa rd situation
in the backseat of a car. You cannot help but sympathize with this poor girl.
Instead of being in the front seat with Tom and Liz, the audience is in the
backseat with the third wheel.
The third wheel  needs to come out of the story so the audience can be
where T om needs them to be: in the front seat, right between him and Liz.
Eliminate people  from stories when they serve no purpose. Prete nd they
aren’ t there. Ghost them.
The Other Houses
That blue door is the third door I knock on that day. I knock  on two
doors before that. At the first house, I’m given three dollars by a woman
who looks as if she doesn’ t have  two nickels to rub together . At the second
home, I get another five dollars. If you remember the story , I needed about
eight dollars to get home.
So why do I knock on the third door?
Randy . He thinks we’ve stumbled upon a new career . He talks me into
knocking on one more door. “We’ll buy candy and soda!” he says. “It’ll be
amazing!”
That’ s when I meet the widower .
Why do those other two houses  come out of the story? They don’t help
me get my audience on that porch with me and the widower . They are
superfluous and unnecessary . They only add unnecessary repetition to the
story . They don’ t make you understand my five-second moment any better .
Winston
Remember the half-naked moun tain man named Winston? I would love
to tell you about Winston. He’s the owner of Winston’ s Garage. He’s half
naked because he’s wearing cutof f overalls and no shirt, and his overalls are
handmade. They  are lined with pockets that are each sized and shaped for a
different tool. Small, medium , and large pockets for each of his
screwdrivers. A holster for his wrench. A V elcro strap for his hammer . He is
plastered in tools like some bizarre suit of armor .
I buy the spare tire from Winston for $110. Every penny to my name.
But when I ask him to drive me back to my car, he says, “That’ll be another
$10.”
“But W inston,” I say . “You know you just took all of my money .”
He smiles. “Good thing tires are round.”
Rolling that spare tire for five miles down a New Hampshire highway
might be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’d love to tell you about Winston
and that damn tire, but none of it helps the audience land in my five-second
moment on a front porch with a widower .
Sadly , Winston must go. Someday I may tell a separate story about him
and his haggling me out of all my money , but that story will be about a
different five-second moment.
Redemption
Storytellers are also allowed to end their stories wherever they want,
thus omitting endings that are undesirable. In “Charity Thief,” I end the
story early . In truth, I return home from New Hampshire feeling terrible
about what I have done. I’ve taken twenty-eight dollars from three
homeowners, faked my mother ’s death, and lied to a man who deserved
better .
So I make a deal with myself: Every time I receive a dollar bill in
change as a customer of McDonald’ s, I’ll put that dollar into the collection
container until I pay back my twenty-eight dollars.
I do this. I pay it back quickly , but I still feel awful about what I have
done. In truth, a part of me still feels terrible to this day. So I continued to
put dollar bills in the container every time I received one as change. I did
this for years. It became a bit of a habit, until one day, I was standing beside
Elysha at a McDonald’ s, and she watched me slide another dollar into the
canister .
“Why do you always put a dollar in the canister every time you’re
here?” she asked.
I told her the story . At that point, I had paid back $604. Ever since
placing that first dollar in the canister , I had been keeping count,  waiting for
the dollar amount that would finally alleviate me of my guilt.
When I was finished with my story , Elysha put her hand on my shoulder
and said, “It’ s okay , Matt. Y ou can let it go.” I did.
The real ending of that story — with my redemption — is terrible. It
ruins the story . But I didn’ t realize this when I first took the stage at
Housing Works in New York City to tell the story at a Moth StorySLAM. I
told a version of the story that included the ending, and George Dawes
Green, founder of The Moth and one of the judges that night, assigned me a
decidedly lower  score than the other judging teams. At that point, I knew
who Geor ge was but had yet to meet him. I had wanted to impress, but
apparently I had failed.
It cost me the victory . I finished one-tenth of one point out of first place.
As I left the bookstore that night, I stepped onto the wet cobbles tones of
Crosby Street and sighed. I was disappointed about how close I had come to
winning. I thought I had told the best story that night.
Suddenly I felt hands on my shoulders. I was spun in place and found
myself facing Geor ge Dawes Green for the first time in my life.
“You ruined that story!” he said.
“What?” I replied, suddenly frightened of the man whom I admired
beyond measure.
“You ruined that story ,” he repeated. “Don’ t ever tell that ending again.
No one wants redemption. Everyone wants the clown.”
Then he released me from his grip, turned, and went back into the
bookstore.
I stood there in the drizzle, my mind reeling.
I thought long and hard about what Geor ge had said on the three-hour
drive home, and by the time I pulled into my driveway , I agree d with what
he had said. The story is better without the redemption.
Here is what I think: A story is like a coat. When we tell a story , we put
a coat on our audience. Our goal is to make that coat as difficult to remove
as possib le. I want that coat to be impossible to take off. Days after you’ve
heard my story at the dinner table or the conference room or the golf course
or the theater , I want you to be thinking about my story . I want that coat to
cling to your body and mind.
The longer that story lingers in the hearts and minds of our audience,
the better the story .
When I tell my audience about the $604, I make it easy for the audience
to remove the coat. “I did a terrible thing, but then I more than made up for
my transgression. The world is back in order . All debts are paid.”
If I don’t tell my audience about my redemption, the world remains
broken. I did a terrible thing, and it still weighs on my soul. It’s a much
more difficult coat to remove. Days later you’ll find yourself thinking about
what I did, because I will still be guilty of the crime in your mind. The
world will still be broken.
Geor ge is right. Audiences don’ t want redemption. Redemption cleanses
the palate. It ties up all loose ends. It makes the world whole again. It
allows your audience to sleep well at night.
I want my audience tossing and turning over my story .
When I write novels, I try to end my story about ten pages before the
reader would want the book to end. In that way, I’m also putting a coat on
my audience. If the reader emai ls me with a question about the end of one
of my books — what happened to Martin and Laura? Are they together?
What did Emma  say to Cassidy ? Is Budo in heaven? Does Caroline ever
reach out to the driver in the accident? — I know I’ve stuck them with a
coat that they cannot shake. I am happy . They are curious about people who
don’t actually exist. My story remains alive in their hearts and minds long
after they have finished reading the last sentence.
Storytellers end their stories in the most advantageous place possible.
They omit the endings that offer neat little bows and happily -ever -afters.
The best stories are a little messy at the end. They offer small steps,
marginal progre ss, questionabl e results. The best stories give rise to
unanswered questions.
I told “Charity Thief” again at a Moth StorySLAM in Boston a couple
of years later. I was chosen to take the stage first that night, which is
typically the kiss of death in a Moth StorySLAM. Score inflation makes it
difficult to win a slam from the first few spots, and it make s it almost
impossible to win from the very first spot of the night. I’ve only seen one
person win a Moth Story-SLAM after having to take the stage first. It was
me. That night.
I left out the redemption.
Storytellers tell the truth by not telling the whole truth.
Lie #2: Compression
Compression is used when storytellers want to push time and space together
in order to make the story easier to comprehend, visualize, and tell.
If the first scene of your story takes place on a Monday , for example,
and the next scene happens on Friday , and you are concerned about the
audience wondering about Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday , you simply
push time together and turn your Monday-through-Friday story into a
Monday-through-T uesday story .
Placing scenes closer together also heightens the drama and suspense of
a story . It makes the world seem more visceral and cinematic.
I tell a story entitled “Bike off Roof,” which tells about the time I rode
my bike off the barn roof as a child to get my mother ’s attention. It doesn’ t
go well. My plan was to jump my bike off the roof and land on two wheels,
but it turns out that physics doesn’ t allow that to happen.
In the story , I talk about planning and executing the jump as a single
continuous scene. The entire story takes place over the course  of a single
afternoon.
In reality, my sister and I planned the jump on one day and I executed it
the next. But why stretch out a story over the course of two days when
nothing of consequence happens between the planning and execution? It’s
easier for an audience to see and understand my story if all the events take
place within a single afternoon.
My Saturday-Sunday story becomes a Saturday-afternoon story. (You
can also find this story on the “Storyworthy the Book” Y ouTube channel.)
Geography can also be compressed for the sake of comprehension and
visualization. I tell a story entitled “The Basin” about dammin g a river in
New Hampshire  to drain the Basin, an enormous granite bowl carved into
the hillside of a mountain by the river. The Basin is a minor tourist
attraction, and after an encount er with an overconfident park ranger , who
assures me that the water has been running through this granite formation
for thousands of years without interruption, I decide to empty his precious
Basin and prove him wrong.
The geography of the story is complicated. The flow of the river and the
location of the highway and my campground upstream can make the story
difficult to follow , so when I tell the story , I push the geography closer
together and eliminate unnecessary locations and barriers completely . I
paint the picture of a single river running from my campground to the
Basin, when in reality it was far more convoluted and wide-ranging.
There is never room for needless complexity in a story . Remember that
stories are like rivers (not unlike  the river I dammed up to empty  the Basin).
They continue to flow even as your audience struggles to understand a time
line or attempts to construct a complicated mental map in their minds. For
this reason, simp licity should be prized at all points. Compression can often
be helpful in this regard.
Lie #3: Assumption
Storytellers use assumption when there is a detail so important to the story
that it must be stated with specificity , so the storyteller makes a reasonable
assumption about what the specifics may be. This does not mean that a
storyteller shoul d assume all details. It is only when the forgotten detail is
critical to the story that an assumption should be made.
I tell a story about the time my brother and I dropped our Batman and
Robin action figures through the rusted-out hole in the floor of my mother ’s
1972 Chevy Chevette as she drove down the highway . We tied rope to the
figures and let out the line until Batman and Robin were bouncing behind
the car. Then we tied off the line on the gearshift and hopped into the way-
back to watch them ricochet off the road and each other . It was the 1970s
version of an iPad. Hours of entertainment on those long drives.
One day Batman ricocheted off Robin and bounced into the opposing
lane and hit a car , setting of f a chain of events that launches the story .
I can’t remember the model or make of the car that Batman hit, but it’s
such a critical moment in the story that I want everyone in the audience to
see the same thing at the same time, so I make an assumption. Since it’s the
1970s, I declare that the car was a station wagon, because that was a
common vehicle on the roads in the seventies.
I’d love to say it was a cherry-red Corvette instead of a station wagon,
because it would make the story more interesting, but when I assume (and I
don’t very often), I always make the most reasonable and likely assumption.
Lie #4: Progression
A lie of progression is when a storyteller changes the order of events in a
story to make it more emotio nally satisfying or comprehensible to the
listener . In my experience, this is the least common lie told, and I have
never done it myself, but I’ve recommended that other storytellers use it
from time to time.
My favorite example is from a storyteller who was placed in charge of
her brother’s ashes following his death. Her brother was a Baltimore
Orioles fan, so she hoped to spread his ashes on Camden Yards, the Orioles’
ballpark.
This is impossib le, of course. If ashes could be spread on professional
baseball fields, stadiums would  be heaped up with ashes and games could
never be played.
Still, she went to Camden Yards three days after the season ended and
spoke to a groundskeeper outside the stadium. They shared an incredible,
tear-filled moment, and then he let her spread her brother ’s ashes on the
foot of the Orioles’ dugout so that every time a player runs onto the field,
he would carry a little bit of her brother with them.
Beautiful. Right? Then she went to Baltimore’ s inner harbor and spread
more of her brother ’s ashes on the doorsteps of his favorite strip clubs, so
every time a man entered a strip club, he would carry a little bit of her
brother with him.
Then she ended her day at a tree where the family picnicked for years.
Family member s gathered for a brief ceremony , and the rema ining ashes
were buried there.
Beautiful story , but told in the wrong order . The Camden Yards moment
is the centerpiece to the story , and it will make you cry, so it needs to
happen at the end of the story . It’s her true five-second moment. Nothing
she says after that moment at the ballpark feels as important.
The strip-club moment should come just before that, because it’s always
better to make people laugh before they cry . It hurts more that way .
And she should open her story at the tree, where she can estab lish the
family members and their relationship and set the scene for all that is to
come.
She isn’t adding anything to the story that doesn’ t already exist. She’s
simply reengine ering the order of events for the benefit of the audience,
who expect an emotional journey to follow a certain trajectory .
Change the order of the story if the real-life order did not adhere to
narrative expect ations. The world does not always bend to serve our stories
best, so we must sometimes bend reality instead.
Lie #5: Conflation
Storytellers use conflation to push all the emotion of an event into a single
time frame, because stories are more entertaining this way. Rather than
describing chang e over a long period, we compress all the intellectual and
emotional transf ormation into a smaller bit of time, because this is what
audiences expect from stories.
For example, I fell in love with a girl named Heather in sixth grade. I
looked across Mrs. Schultz’ s classroom and saw Heather in a way I had
never seen her before. It was the moment I went from a boy who thought
nothing of girls to a boy who couldn’ t stop thinking about girls. Heather
was beautiful, funny , athletic, and best of all, she didn’ t seem to give a
damn about what others thought. I have often thought that confidence is the
most attractive quality in a person.
I loved Heather  throughout all of sixth grade but was too afraid to do
anything about it. I watched her from afar and dreamed of the day we might
be together .
In seventh grade, Heather and I went off to high school and joined the
marching band. I was a member of the drum corps, and she transitioned
from flute player to drum major . I saw her a lot. I stared at her as she
conducted the band, because I needed to in order to keep time and play
well, but also because I wanted to stare at her as often as possible.
Later we both joined the track team and saw even more of each other .
Still I did nothing.
In eighth and ninth grades, I tried to talk to Heather . Tried to make her
laugh. Prayed that she would take notice of me. She started dating a guy
named Greg, which was one of the universe’ s greatest tragedies.
What were you thinking, Heather?
Still I didn’ t care. I still tried like hell to get her attention. In tenth grade,
Heather and I were in biology class together . Being a fifteen-year -old boy, I
was convinced that the best way to get a girl’s attention was to treat
teachers terribly , disrupt class, and show as little interest in learning as
possible. I honestly thought that acting like a criminal would finally make
Heather realize all that she was missing. So I began treating Mrs. Murphy ,
our biology teacher , terribly .
I tell a story about it. At the end, after describing how I failed miserably
to get the attent ion of anyone except Mrs. Murphy , I say, “That was the
moment when I realized that Heather would never be mine.”
This is not entirely true. If I’m being honest, I never really thought that
Heather would be mine. As much as I dreamed about the two of us being
together , I strongly suspected that I had a snowball’ s chance in hell of ever
making it happen.
Besides, even after my biology- class failure, I still held out hope for our
union, struggling  to get her to see me at band camp the following summer .
But it’s a far more interestin g story if I take all the emotional and
intellectual trans formation of the four previous years before biology class
and the summer after biology class and squeeze it into that one class.
That is conflatio n. I conflate the emotions of the moment. I transform a
moment into the moment.
Movies do this all the time. If you track the number of days that pass
over the course of the average movie, the number is small. A lot of stuff is
often jammed into one or two days of movie time, when in real life, no one
ever has days so packed with action.
Think again about the Ocean’ s Eleven franchise. Danny Ocean and his
gang plan their heist over the course of just a few days, struggling to
complete the preparations for the robbery in time. In real life, the
multimillion-dollar robbery of a casino might take years to plan, but years
are boring. Days are thrilling.
Conflation will also help you to keep your stories shorter , which is
always a good thing. Shorter stories, onstage and in real life, are always
more entertaining. Audiences would much rather hear about the moment I
realized that Heather would never be my girlfriend than the process by
which I slowly came to understand this.
Feel the dif ference?
One more cavea t to all these permissible lies: using these lies strategically
works great until someone who is directly involved in the story is standing
beside you, listening.
If I were  to tell “Bike off Roof” in the presence of my sister , Kelli, she
might interject and remind me that we actually planned my infamous jump
off the barn roof the day before.
This can be anno ying beyond imagination. “Yeah,” I’d say. “I know , but
it’s a better story if I just push those two days into a single day . Okay?”
“Why?” she might ask.
Now what? Do I try to explain to her that books are lakes and stories are
rivers? Do I tell her that I want my stories to be easily visualized and
understood? Do I lecture her on how Steven Soderber gh forces Danny
Ocean’ s crew to plan their casino heist in just a few days because that’s
what an audie nce wants? Or should I just tell her that she’s not
remembering it right? It’ s never good.
Elysha does this to me a lot. As I’m telling a story to friends at a party
or students in a workshop, she’ll interrupt and tell me that I’m getting it
wrong. I’ve forgotten the third wheel. Squished together the days. Failed to
tell the real end to the story .
Sometimes this is helpful, like when I mistakenly believed that I was the
one who burned his hand on that frying pan. If I’m crafting a story, that’s a
great time to help me get the story straight. Not when I’m in the middle of
telling it.
While I was telling the story of our daughter ’s birth, Elysha interrupted
to remind me that there were two doctors with us behind the curtain during
her C-section instead of just the one I mentioned.
I know there were two doctors back there. Both were anesthesiologists.
But only one plays a role in the story . He looks over the curtain and says,
“It’s a girl.”
I remove the third wheel from the story to eliminate some of the mental
clutter . Fewer superfluous people make for a better story . It’s easier to
visualize three instead of four. And that other doctor never did anything as
far as I’m conce rned. So like Randy and Winston and the girl in the back of
Tom’s car, he is removed.
I understand Elysha’ s intent. She doesn’ t want the reality of her life
altered by my telling of a story . She would prefer that her mem ories of that
important day remain accurate.
I understand. I want my memories of that day to remain accurate too.
Except when I’m telling stories.
STORY BREAK
Doubt Is the Enemy of Every Storyteller
For me as a storyteller — and perhaps a human being — one of the worst
things that can happen is to have someone doubt my story .
I have stood on stages all over the world and shared some of the most
difficult and painful moments of my life. Embarrassing situations.
Despicable decisions. Immoral acts. Heartbreaking, life-altering events. I’ve
also shared the occasional trium ph. Important revelations. Thos e tiny steps
forward. I don’ t hold back. I always share the truth. The uglier , the better .
Nevertheless, five times in my life, someone has expressed doubt about
one of my stories.
At a Moth Story SLAM at Housing Works in Manhattan in 2014, I told
the story of cheating in my high-school science fair and placing third,
propelling me on to the state finals at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. After
leaving the stage, a man approached and said, “Good story , but I don’t
know if it’ s true.”
After telling a story at Speak Up about the time I taught my students to
lie so we could win a schoolwide penny drive, a man said, “Funny story , but
I have a hard time believing it.” On that night, my former principal — who
played a key role in the story — was in the audience. I offered to bring the
man to my former principal for verification, but he passed. Not surprising.
A maga zine editor once rejected one of my stories, claiming that she
doubted that my moment of revelation was as succinct and powerful as I
made it out to be.
I won’ t go into details regarding the other two incidents (though one
story involves my best friend, who remains annoyed to this day about
anyone doubting our adventure) , but all five expressions of doubt cut me to
the bone. Not only did they hurt me in the moment, but they led me to
wonder if they are just the tip of the iceber g.
How many more people out there doubt my stories?
People who take my storytelling workshops quickly understand how
and why I have  so many stories to tell. I teach strategies and exercises
designed to find and develop stories from our lives. I’ve dedicated my life
to finding these storyworthy moments, and as my wife is fond of saying, I
am often able to turn many seemingly small moments into fully realized
stories. I’ve also admittedly led a storyworthy life.
It’s not the life I would have necessarily chosen, but it is mine. It’s my
truth. It’ s me.
To doubt my stories is to doubt my life. Doubting my stories means that
the struggle and pain and terror and embarrassment that I have suffered is
called into question. It means that my scars — both physical and emotional
— are irrelevant. It renders the vulnerability I am willing to brave onstage
meaningless.
It hurts. It hurts more than you could imagine.
I have been to hundreds of storytelling shows and heard thousands of
stories, and I have heard a few that I doubt. Perhaps more than a few. But I
always listen with an open heart and mind, and if I doubt the veracity of a
story , I keep my mouth shut, because I don’t know for sure. I will never
know for sure. And I know how much it hurts to have someone doubt a
story that is true.
It requires courage to stand on a stage and share your most private and
painful moment s. It requires almost nothing to stab that story teller in the
heart with a dagger filled with doubt. It’s only happened to me five times in
more than six years of storytellin g, and yet each one of those expressions of
doubt still hurts me today . I remember them as if they were yesterday .
It’s hard to live a hard life and be told that you are not believed. It’s no
fun to work on a story for days, weeks, months, and even years, only to be
told by someone that they don’ t think it’ s true.
Words rarely hurt me anymore. A lifetime of fight and struggle have
blunted most of their power over me. But these words of doubt — these
small moments of skepticism — are piercing and permanent.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
Cinema of the Mind (Also Known
as “Where the Hell Are You?”)
I’ve talked about movies a lot so far. Perhaps you’ve noticed. There’ s a
good reason.
A great storyteller creates a movie in the minds of the audience.
Whether your audience is a theater full of storytelling fans, a boardroom
filled with poten tial clients, a classroom bursting with apathetic high-school
students, or a group of friends around the dinner table, the goal of every
storyteller shoul d be to create a cinematic experience in the minds of every
listener .
This is important. You may think it’s obvious, but if it were, storytellers
would do this all the time. They would obsess about the idea of maintaining
an unrelenting, uninterrupted movie in the minds of their listeners.
But they don’t. Often, instead of making the story the center of their
performance, storytellers make themselves the center of the show . They
crack jokes. Insert amusing or observational non sequiturs. Step outside the
story’ s time line. Ask rhetorical questions of the audience.
These are all terrible ways to start stories. Rather than presenting a fully
realized cinematic experience, they present bits of the movie. They give a
scene here or a scene there, intersected by unnecessary or poorly formatted
exposition that ruins the flow .
Even worse, they open stories by pontificating and proselytizing:
Love is a beautiful thing when it isn’ t killing you.
There are two kinds of toddlers in this world: those who raise your
hopes for humanity and those who belong in a cage.
I used to think that I understoo d my mother better than anyon e in
the world, but now I know that mothers are like oceans: deep ,
dark, and full of secr ets.
These are not the beginnings  to stories. These are senten ces that
supposedly state some universal truth that the story will then illustrate. But
this is not how stories work. Stories are not supposed to start with thesis
statements or overwrought aphorisms.
Let me say it again, because it’s that important: A great storyteller
creates a movie in the mind of the audience. Listeners should be able to see
the story in their mind’ s eye at all times. At no point should the story
become visually obscured or impossible to see. As the title of this chapter
suggests, ef fective storytelling is cinema of the mind.
In order to achieve this lofty goal, storytellers must do one thing, and
happily for you, it’ s exceedingly simple:
Always pr ovide a physical location for every moment of your story .
That’ s it. If the audience knows  where you are at all times within your
story , the movie  is running in their minds. The film is cycling from reel to
reel. If your audience can pictur e the location of the action at all times, you
have created a movie in the mind of your listeners. Hopefully  it’s a good
one.
If the audience can’t see your story in their minds, the film is no longer
running. You have failed to achieve cinema of the mind. Instead of
visualizing the past, perhaps even forgetting where and when they even are
for a moment, your audience is now staring at you in the present. Their
imagination has been disengaged. The movie has stopped.
This is no longer storytelling ; it’s lecturing. If you’re making the
audience laugh, it might be more akin to stand-up comedy . You may even
sound as if you’re reciting an essay. Whatever you are doing, if the movie
has stopped in the mind of your audience, it’s no longer a story . Let me give
you an example. Here are two versions of the first few lines of a story that I
tell about my fraternal grandmother .
Version #1
My grandmother ’s name is Odelie Dicks, which probably explains why she
is who she is. She’s a crooked old lady in both body and mind. She wears
only dark colors and likes to serve food that has stewed in pots for days. I
like to imagine that there was a time in her life when she smiled — or at
least didn’ t scowl — but if that time existed, it was long before me.
Version #2
I’m standing at the edge of my grandmother ’s garden, watching her
relentlessly pull weeds from the unfor giving soil. My grandmother ’s name
is Odelie Dicks, which probably explains why she is who she is. She’s a
crooked old lady in both body and mind. She wears only dark colors and
likes to serve food that has stewed in pots for days. I like to imagine that
there was a time in her life when she smiled — or at least didn’ t scowl —
but if that time existed, it was long before me.
One of these versions is the beginning of a story . The other sounds more
like the beginning of an essay . Can you see the dif ference? Can you feel it?
If a director were filming the first version of my story , the movie would
probably open on black. The description of my grandmothe r would be
conveyed via voice-over . There’ s nothing for the audience to see, because
no location is ever identified. It’s almost impossible to imagine my
grandmother , because there is no place to imagine her in. At best you might
picture an ethereal image of her floating in space. More than likely , you’re
not picturing anything at all. You’re probably staring at the storyteller ,
waiting for him or her to engage your imagination more fully. There is no
movie running in your mind. It’ s merely a series of anecdotal descriptors.
In the second version, an image is instantly formed in your mind. A
director would know exactly where to point the camera.
Can you see it? The lens pans across a garden on a summer day . You see
me standing on the edge of the garden, staring at an old woman who is
crouching somewhere between rows of vegetable plants. As I describe her,
you see her bending over, pulling a weed, bending again. There is action.
Specificity . Setting. You don’t know what my grandmother ’s garden looks
like, but that’s okay . Your mind  instantly fills in those blanks for me. You
place your own idea of a garden  into the scene, and because the dimensions
and size and general appearance of my grandmother ’s garden are not
relevant to the story , I allow this to happen. I allow you to populate my
story with your details. With very little effort, your mind formulates a fully
realized scene, with depth, color, and texture, and all I did was give the
moment a specific location.
One extra sentence has changed the story entirely . Actually , it made it a
story .
In truth,  this moment in the garden has nothing to do with the actual
story , which is about the cruel way that my grandmother would pull my
loose teeth when I was a little boy, and as a result, I wasn’ t sad when she
died. I’m not even sure if she was working in the garden on the day or week
or month that she pulled the particular tooth in question. It doesn’t matter . I
need you to get to know my grandmother before I can launch into the story ,
and the garden is a good place to start. It’s where my grandmo ther spent a
great deal of her time, and I can use the way she pulled the weeds to
foreshadow the way she would eventually pull my teeth.
Rather than describing my grandmother in essay form or cracking a
series of jokes about her, I set the moment in a location, and therefore I
create a scene. I start to make a movie in your mind.
One version is a story . The other version is an essay . The only
difference is that I provided a location for one but not the other .
That’ s it. That’ s how you maintain a cinema in the mind of your
audience. You give every scene a location, just as you would in a movie. Do
this, and your stories will instantly improve. In fact they will be
transformed. They will become captivating and memorable and visceral for
your audiences simply because you set every moment in a specific location.
It sounds easy, and in many ways it is, but it can also get tricky at times.
Look back at “Charity Thief” in chapter 6. There’s a mom ent in that story
when I have to provide a great deal of backstory for my audien ce. Before I
get to the point where I formulate my plan to beg from the gas-station
employee, I need my audience to know that:
1.My mother is living on welfare with my pregnant teenage sister .
2.My brother has joined the army and has been out of touch with
us for a year .
3.I haven’ t seen my father in ten years.
4.I’m making $7.25 an hour as a McDonald’ s manager , and I’m
the richest person I know .
5.None of my friends has a car that can make the round-trip
journey to pick me up. None of them have credit cards or even
checking accounts.
6.My only hope is Bengi, my roommate and best friend, and he is
away at a college retreat, unreachable by telephone.
7.Telephones in the precellular era were inefficient means of
communication.
8.I feel alone.
9.I fear that I will be alone for the rest of my life.
10. I find my situation terribly unfair .
It’s a lot of information to dump on an audience. A whol e bunch of
backstory , which can often derail a story if it is not told well.
But did you notice what I did just before I started explaining my
backstory? I tell the audience that I’m parked in the lot of a Citgo gas
station in New Hampshire, sitting behind the wheel of my car, hands still
gripping the steering wheel. I give this moment of backstory a place. I make
it a scene.
Even though I’m covering an enormous amount of terrain, including
information about my family , friends, and my own internal struggle, the
audience can still picture me behind the wheel of my car as these thoughts
race through my mind. I position my body clearly in a space that my
audience can imagine. They can see me sitting in the front seat of a 1976
Chevy Malibu. They can see the parking lot. The red-and-white  Citgo sign.
The gas pumps. The highway . Since I identify the state as New Hampshire,
they are probabl y picturing trees and maybe even mountains in the distance
or a hardscrabble road.
Halfway through  this bit of backstory , I intentionally reset my location.
I mentio n it again, just in case the audience has forgotten where I am. Still
behind the wheel, still looking out at a field of yellows and reds and
oranges.
No real action is taking place as I provide this backstory , but that’s okay .
There is someth ing to look at because you know exactly where I am. You
can see me. I’m a young man sitting behind the wheel of a motionless
vehicle, staring into a future that is bleak at best. The story never goes off
the rails. The film never stops. Y ou never wonder where I am.
In the movie version of this moment, the camera would cut between
interior and exterior shots of the car. It would focus on my hands, still
clutching the steering wheel in desperation. There might be a slow pan of
the Citgo station to create an establishing shot. A close- up on my
Massachusetts license plate in order to accentuate my distance from home.
A long shot of the gas pumps to suggest the distance between me and the
gas I need to get home. A still shot of the two large numbers indicating that
gas is eighty-fiv e cents a gallon . You’d see mountains in the distance and
cars filled with gas zooming by on the nearby highway .
Even with all that relatively inactive backstory , it’s still a movie. You
can see it. It has place and sound and detail.
Many storytellers introduce backstory like this with sentences such as
these:
You have to understand what was going on in my life at the time . . .
Let me tell you about my finances in 1991 . . .
There wer e many r easons why I couldn’ t call home for help that day .
It would have been nice to be able to call friends and family for help
that day , but I couldn’ t. Her e’s why .
I hear setups for backstory like this all the time, but none of these
approaches are effective. This is not how movies work. Narra tors do not
appear on-screen to fill in back stories or provide pertinent details in the
midst of a scene. Instead movies use flashbacks. Purposeful dialogue.
Voice-over . Awful dream sequences.
Regardless of the method, it’s still a movie. The camera is still pointed
at a specific place. The audience can still see the movie. By placing this
backstory in a specific location,  I am able to convey this inform ation from
the perspective of my 1991 self rather than my present-day self. I stay
within the conte xt of the story . The place and time frame remain constant.
It’s the twenty-year -old version  of myself explaining the backstory rather
than the modern-day version standing on the stage.
This process allows the movie  to continue rolling in the audience’ s
mind. They are still listening to the version of me from the past, so they
remain in the past with me.
A similar problem occurs when  a storyteller needs to provide historical
or technical information that the audience may not possess. I once worked
with a storytell er who needed to ensure that his audience understood
photosynthesis in order for the rest of his story to make sense. His original
plan was to say something like, “Okay , before I continue, I need to give you
a quick refresher on photosyn thesis. If you remember your freshman
biology class . . .” and then proceed to explain the process to his audience.
At that moment, his story stopped being a story . It became a science
lecture within a story . The only thing the audience could see during that
explanation was the storyteller , standing on the stage, discussing a scientific
principle. The movie had stopped running. The filmstrip had snapped in
two.
I advised the storyteller against this approach. I explained why it wasn’ t
working. I told him that his science lecture was not entertaining and
destroyed the flow of his story . It cut of f the cinema of the mind.
“Then how am I supposed to teach them about photosynthe sis?” he
asked.
“Why not tell the story of the first time you learned about
photosynthesis?” I said. “Or a time when you taught photosynthesis?
Instead of stopping the story completely to explain the process, why not
offer a scene in the form of a flashback that also explains photosynthesis?
Just keep telling a story .”
If I had to expla in photosynthesis, I told him, I would probably insert an
anecdote from my tenth-grade biology class. I would describe Mrs. Murphy ,
my biology teacher , standing at the chalkboard, explaining with crude
drawings and hastily scribbled  labels how plants took in sunlight and
carbon dioxide and produced oxygen. Mrs. Murphy was so excited about
the way photo synthesis work ed that she could barely contain her
enthusiasm. She admired the efficiency and symbiotic nature of the process,
and she couldn’ t wait for us to understand it.
At the time I was less excited about photosynthesis than I was about
Heather , the girl who sat across from me. Y ou’ll remember that Heather was
the girl whose love I tried to win in Mrs. Murphy’ s class back in chapter 10 .
In many ways, I might explain, Heather was the sun and carbon dioxide
to my oxygen. She was what I needed to be happy . If only she could
provide me with these essential ingredients. Sadly , that never happened.
Heather started dating Greg, and the couple remained together throughout
much of high school.
See what I mean? Rather than stopping the story to explain a scientific
principle, I allow the story to continue with a little bit of anecdotal
backstory . I provide the necessary scientific information while also
providing an amusing scene that reveals something about my character .
Depending on the needs of the story , I could easily have replaced the
Heather part of the story with Sean, a redheaded boy who was also in my
biology class that year. Sean was a bully who made my life hell for several
years before we finally found a grudging respect for each other . I might
explain that Sean was the opposite of photosynthesis. Lacking any hint of
symbiosis.
I also could have replaced Heather with Jennifer Glose, a girl in that
same biology class. I once tortur ed her by adding a new element to the large
periodic table of elements that hung in the front of Mrs. Murphy’ s
classroom: GloseGrossium.
I did such a precise job adding the element to the table — making it
look exactly like the other boxe s on the chart — that when Mrs. Murphy
pulled the chart down, it took her fifteen minutes to notice the addition.
I might tell my audience that I spent more time crafting that new
element for Mrs. Murphy’ s periodic table than I did studying
photosynthesis.
All of these anecdotes reveal something about my character and also
allow me to explain photosynthesis to anyone in the audience who doesn’ t
understand it already . Most importantly , they all allow for the movie to
continue in the minds of the audience. I provide setting and action and
character rather than lecture.
That’ s the trick.  A simple one: Make sure that every moment  in your
story has a location attached. Every moment should be a scene, and every
scene needs a setting.
It’s the simplest, most-bang-for -your -buck strategy that I have to of fer.
CHAPTER TWELVE
The Principle of But and Therefore
Every Monday morning,  I invite my fifth-grade students to share their
One-Sentence Weekends. This is their opportunity to tell me the most
important or momentous moment from their weekend.
I do this for a few reasons:
1.Kids can’t wait to tell me about  their weekends, but I just don’t
have the time to hear all their stories, nor do I want to. As much
as I love them, even I have limits on how many cousin’ s
birthday parties and early-morn ing soccer games that I can hear
about on a given day. One-Sent ence Weekends give everyone a
chance to share one thing from their weekend and feel
marginally satisfied without threatening my sanity .
2.I’m teaching my students to find their five-second moments. I
don’t use this language in class — at least not initially — but we
talk about what is interesting to other people and what is not. My
school psychologist actually supports the idea of teaching
students about what topics other people might find interesting
and what they might consider less so, though she questions the
ruthless nature of my assessment at times. Shouting “Boring!” or
“Yawn City!” at a student is apparently not the best teaching
strategy , at least in her profes sional opinion. Still, it works.
“Don’ t tell us everything about your weekend,” I say. “Find the
most interesting or compelling moment, and just share that.”
3.I’m also reinforcing grammar . Students are forced to compose
their thoughts in a single sentence and must avoid run-on
sentences.
4.I’m teaching and encouraging active listening.
When a student tells us someth ing that is genuinely interesting, I often
ask follo w-up questions. Somet imes I allow the student to expound upon
the moment. Occasionally a student will even tell a story .
It was while I was listening to one of these stories that it finally
occurred to me why I despise so many of them: the word and.
My students tend to connect sentences, paragraphs, and scenes together
with the word and more than with any other conjunction. This results in
terrible stories.
Here is a word-for -word account of one of my students’ stories:
My cousin Lisa came over for a sleepover , and we went to bed on
time and we didn’t sleep. When everyone was asleep we snuck
downstairs and watched TV. And my parents heard us, and they
thought the voices on the TV were burglars robbing the house and
they called the police. They didn’t wake us up because they didn’t
want us to be scared and they didn’ t check my room. My dad waited
upstairs with a baseball bat. The police came to the house and saw
us watch ing TV through the window . They called my parents and
told them that it was us downstairs, and we got in so much tr ouble.
This is a story with a lot of potential. It at least has the makings of a solid,
amusing anecdote, but it is told poorly . In the monotonous storytelling voice
of a child, even an amusing anecdote can become agony .
Once I realized the mistake that my students were making, I started
listening to adults, and I quickly  realized that even experienced storytellers
onstage do the same thing. A clear majority of human beings tend to
connect their sentences, paragraphs, and scenes together with the word and.
This is a mistake . The ideal connective tissue in any story are the words
but and therefore, along with all their glorious synonyms. These buts and
therefores can be either explicit or implied.
“And” stories have no movemen t or momentum. They are equiv alent to
running on a treadmill. Sentences and scenes appear , one after another , but
the movement is straightforward and unsurprising. The momentum is
unchanged.
But and therefore are words that signal change. The story was heading
in one direction, but now it’s heading in another . We started out zigging, but
now we are zagging. W e did this, and therefore this new thing happened.
I think of it as continually cutting against the grain of the story . Rather
than stretching a flat line from beginning to end, the storyteller should seek
to create a serrated line cutting back and forth, up and down, along the path
of the story . We are still headed in the same direction, but the best
storytellers don’ t take a straight line to get there.
Look at my student’ s story rewritten with this but-and-therefore
principle. I’ve bolded all the buts and therefores and all their synonyms, and
I’ve added the implied equivalents in parentheses as well.
My cousin Lisa came over for a sleepover , but we had no intention
of sleeping. We went to bed on time, but we didn’t close  our eyes.
Instead  we snuck down stairs when everyone was asleep to watch
TV. But my parents heard us, except  it wasn ’t us they heard. It was
the TV. They heard the strange voices of our television program.
Instead of investigating the voices, they (therefore ) assumed that
burglars were robbing the house, so they called the police. But they
didn’ t wake us up because  they didn’ t want us to be scared, so Dad
waited upstairs with a baseball bat. The police came to the house,
but instead  of finding burglars stealing our few precious belongs,
they found us watching TV. (Therefore ) they called my parents and
told them that it was us downstairs, watching television. (As a
result ,) we got in so much tr ouble.
Better . Right? Can we see how the sentences constantly cut against each
other to add momentum, change, and action?
Let’s look at the first few paragraphs of “Charity Thief.” I’ll make the
same notations of the buts and therefores, along with their synonyms.
It’s the fall of 1991. I’m twenty years old. I’m driving down a lonely
stretch of New Hampshir e highway . I’m driving home from the very
first booty call of my entire life, and I’m excited because  (but) I
don’t know that this is also going to be the very last booty call of my
entire life.
It’s in this moment of excitement that the right front tire of my
1976 Chevy Malibu blows out, but it doesn’ t just deflate. It
disintegrates. It throws rubber and wire across the road in a way I
didn’ t think was possible, and (therefore ) it takes  everyth ing I have
to get the car over to the shoulder and to a stop.
And it’ s 1991. ( Therefore ) I don’t have a cell phone. I don’t have
a spare tire. I haven’ t seen a car on this stretch of road for a long
time. So (therefore ) I do the only thing I can think of doing: I start
hiking back up the r oad to sear ch for help.
Seven hours later, after having given all my money to a half-
naked mountain man named Winston in exchange for a balding
spare tire, I’m (therefore ) back on the road, heading home, a
hundr ed miles between me and my apartment in Attlebor o,
Massachusetts, when I look at the instrument panel and (therefore )
see that I have no gas.
All the money I had — every penny to my name — is in the
hands of a half-naked mountain  man. I don’t have a credit card. I
don’t have an A TM car d. I don’ t even have a checking account.
So I take the next exit and roll my car into a Citgo station, and
as I park the car on the edge of the lot, facing a field of fall foliage, I
grip the steering wheel in anger . I’m angry , but I’m also sad. I’m
twenty years old. I’m a McDona ld’s manager . I make $7.25 an hour,
and (but) I am the riche st person I know. My mother is living on
welfar e with my pregnant teenage sister . My brother joined the army
a year ago, and I haven’ t heard from him since. My father
disappear ed from my life ten years ago. (Therefore ) the only person
I know who can help me, who even has a credit card or a car that
can make this hundred-mile trip to New Hampshir e, is my friend
Bengi, and he is off on some college weekend. (Therefore ) I can’t
get in touch with him, because  in 1991, when  you want to call
someone, you need to make a phone ring on a wall, and (but) you
need to make that phone ring at the moment the person you want to
speak to is near that phone, and (but) you need the number for the
phone to make it ring, and (therefore ) all of that is impossible for
me to get.
This was not the plan for my life. I’m sitting behind the wheel,
staring into a field of bright colors, yet I feel anything but bright. I
was not suppose d to be this alone this early in my life. You’re not
supposed to be twenty years old and have absolutely no one in your
life to call for help. As I sit there in my car, staring into that field of
orange and yellow , I (therefore ) see my futur e ahead of me. An
endless series of moments just like this one, when I need help but
will have none.
So I make a plan. I’m going to beg for gas, because  it’s 1991.
Gas is eighty-five cents a gallon, so eight dollars is all I need to get
me home. I’ll offer my license, my wallet, everything in my car as
collateral in exchange for eight dollars’ worth of gas and the
promise that I will return and repay the money and more. Whatever
it takes.
So I rehear se my pitch, take a deep breath, and walk in. There’s
a kid behind the counter , probably about my age. I tell him my
problem. I ask him to help. I make my offer. (But) the kid refuses. He
doesn’ t want to risk his job.
Do you see the way the sentenc es, paragraphs, and scene work against
each other? They either oppose the previous sentence (it was this, but now
it’s this) or they compile the previous sentences into a new idea (this plus
this equal this).
This is effective  storytelling. It’s a way of making a story feel as if it’s
constantly going someplace new, even if the events are linear and
predictable.
It’s the dif ference between these two statements:
I loved Heather  since sixth grade, but as much as I loved her, she
was never mine.
I loved Heather since sixth grade. She was never my girlfriend.
One feels better than the other , doesn’ t it?
The first example has a single sentence that accomplishes much more
than the two sentences in the second example. That single sentence:
1.Climbs to the summit of a hill (I loved Heather since sixth grade
. . .).
2.Rests at the top for a moment (. . . but as much as I loved her . .
.).
3.Falls down the backside of that hill (. . . she was never mine).
It zigs and then zags. It says this and then that. The two clauses work
against each other , creating a sense of action and movement.
The second example consists of two independent sentences. They are
related, for sure, but they’re not working in concert with each other . They
are not connected by opposition or culmination. The second example is
flatter and less interesting than the first. It contains the same information,
but it does not move. It doesn’ t cut against the grain of the flat line of the
story . It hugs the line. There is less unexpectedness and surprise. Less
movement. Less delight.
Once I noticed this truth about storytelling, I went back and listened to
my own stories and found myself “butting” and “thereforeing” my way
through all of them. It’s a natural tendency that I seem to have developed
somewhere along the way, probably thanks to the writing that I’ve been
doing all my life.
I discovered that I had unconsciously embraced this but-and-therefore
principle long ago, even though I could certainly be butting and
thereforeing more strategically and consistently .
I started teaching this technique in workshops, and my students adopted
it quickl y. As my students’ ands became buts and therefores, their stories
improved almost immediately . Performances that felt flat and lukewarm
suddenly had an energy and spirit to them that had previously been
unrealized.
Students reported that using this technique also helped them craft their
stories. They suddenly had a better sense of direction. They could better
determine how the next scene should open. One student said, “I feel like I
know where to go next in my stories. When I’m stuck, I just look for the but
and the therefore.”
About a year after I stumbled upon this principle, a student directed me
to an online video of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators  and writers
of South Park . They had joined a college writing class at NYU and
described stumbling upon this principle as well.
Parker and Stone explained that as they storyboard each scene  in their
show , they have  found that they must be able to connect the scenes (they
refer to them as beats ) with a but or a therefore for the next scene to work.
If the words and then can be placed between any two scenes, Parker says,
“You’re fucked.”
Matt Stone says it’s this “causation between each scene that makes a
story .” This happens, therefor e that happens, but then this happens,
therefore that happens.
Apparently I wasn’ t the only one to discover this principle. At least I’m
in good company .
Stone is right. It’s the causation, or the causal links between sentences,
paragraphs, and scenes that make a story . It’s the interconnectedness of
moments that brings meaning to an otherwise linear collection of events
connected only by time and space.
Just listen to someone tell you about their vacation to Europe or their
weekend at the beach. It’s almost never a good story . It’s almost never
something you want to hear . Why?
“First we went here, and it was amazing, and then we went here, and it
was also amazing, and then we saw this, which was so amazing.”
Kill me.
But this is how people often tell stories of their vacations. Instead of
talking about a moment of great  meaning they have had, they instead recite
the itinerary , adding in descript ions and food choices for each place they
visited. This is not a story . It’s a boring, meaningless stroll down memory
lane.
Stories are not a simple recounting of events. They are not a thorough
reporting of moments over a given period of time. Stories are the crafted
representation of events that are related in such a way to demonstrate
change over time in the life of the teller . Applying the but-and-therefore
principle to your stories, both formal and anecdotal, will make you the kind
of person people want to listen to.
One other aspect to the but-a nd-therefore principle: the power of the
negative.
Oddly , the negative is almost always better than the positive when it
comes to storytelling. Saying what something or someone is not is almost
always better than saying what something or someone is. For example:
I am dumb, ugly , and unpopular .
I’m not smart, I’m not at all good-looking, and no one likes me.
The second sentence is better , isn’t it? Here’ s why: it contains a hidden
but. It presents both possibilities. Unlike the first sentence, which only
offers single descriptors, the second sentence offers a binary . It presents the
potential of being smart and not smart, good-looking and not good-looking,
popular and unpopular .
The second sentence really says this: I could be smart, but I’m dumb. I
could be good-looking, but I’m ugly. I could be popular , but no one likes
me.
By sayin g what I am not, I am also saying what I could have been, and
that is a hidden but.
This probably sounds a little wonky and overspecific, but it makes a real
difference when speaking to people.
“I was lost” is just not as good as “I could not find my way home.”
“Heather is my ex-girlfriend” is not as good as “Heather is no longer my
girlfriend.”
“I was penniless” is not as good as “I didn’ t have a penny to my name.”
This isn’t alway s true, of course . A short, positive statement at the end
of a paragraph of description can often serve as an amusing button to a
scene.
Heather laughed  at me when I wasn’t trying to be funny . She refused
my offer of a birthday cupca ke, claiming she’d already had a
cupcake that day, even though it was only 9:30 AM. She chose to
walk five miles home from school, even though I offered her a ride
and she lived next door to me. Heather despised me.
That short, positive statement at the end of the paragraph serves to
summarize all that came before. Inflection and timing can make  that simple
sentence amusing. It might even get a laugh.
But did you notice the three sentences before that last one? Each one of
them contained an implied hidden but.
Heather laughed at me when ( but) I wasn’ t trying to be funny .
She refused my offer of a birthday cupcake, claiming she’d already
had a cupcake that day , even though ( but) it was only 9:30 AM.
She chose to walk five miles home from school, even though (but) I
offered her a ride and she lived next door to me.
Three sentences embracing the power of the negative, followed by a single,
positive statement to summarize.
Simple, positive statements are also preferred when answering
questions. In answer to the question, “Who is Heather?” a statement like
“my ex-girlfriend” is more effective than “She was once my girlfriend.”
Short answers to simple questions should never feel dramatic or crafted.
“She was once my girlfriend” does not pass the Dinner T est.
But when telling a story , these negative statements often serve the
storyteller better . By presenting  a binary option, they provide depth and
potential to a story . They infus e a story with movement, mom entum, and
action. The audience feels as if they’re going places as they climb and
descend the hills of possibility .
STORY BREAK
Storytelling Makes You Just Like Family
I flew into Chicago on a stormy day in December 2016 to perform for the
Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District holiday party . I was supposed to
catch a connecting flight to the Champaign airport, but a snowstorm had
canceled the flight. Karl, the CEO, picked me up at the airport. It was about
a two-hour drive through cornfields from Chicago to Champaign.
When Karl picked me up, he informed me that he had just left his
family’ s holiday  party , which was a short drive from the airport. He needed
to return to pick up his wife and kids before we all headed to Champaign
together .
“Would you mind coming in for a few minutes?” he asked. “The family
sort of knows who you are. They’d like to meet you.”
I agreed, of course.
I was greeted by a raucous group of partygoers who knew more about
me than I had expected. It felt as if they had spent the entire day watching
my YouTube channel. They hugged me like a long-lost friend. Clapped me
on the back like a neighborhood pal. It was sweet.
This is a truth about storytellin g: You develop an inverse relationship
with your audie nce. The more you tell, the better the audience knows you,
particularly given the nature of the stories we tell. It’s common for me to
meet someone who knows a great deal of my personal history while I don’t
know the person’ s first name.
It also means that you can find yourself celebrating Christma s with a
family in Illinois, who welcome you in like one of their own, while you
struggle to keep track of who is who.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“This Is Going to Suck”
I’m going to tell you another story now. I mentioned it in a previous
chapter , so you may have already listened to it on the “Storyworthy the
Book” YouTube channel. If you haven’ t, you should, if possible . It’s always
better to listen to a story told live.
I’m placing the story here because it serves as an excellent model for
the next couple of chapters. I first told this story at a Moth GrandSLAM in
New York City. I finished in first place that night, then I expand ed the story
and told it at a Moth Mainstage in Pittsbur gh. It’s since aired on The Moth
Radio Hour .
It’s December 23, 1988. I’m seventeen years old. I’m comin g out of a
record store. As I hit the sidewalk, my friend Pat sees me. He asks me
what’ s in the shopping bag I’m holding. I tell him it’s a concert  T-shirt. It’s
a Christmas present for Bengi, our friend, and my best friend. A surprise
Christmas present.
Pat looks at me a little funny . He’s only fourteen, but he’s alread y cooler
than I will ever be in my entire life. So when he looks at me like that, I
always pay attention. Pat tells me that guys don’t buy Chris tmas presents
for other guys. Especially surprise Christmas presents. He tells me that he’s
had girlfriends for six months and never bought them a thing. So for me to
buy Bengi a Christmas present is a little odd.
I’m suddenly feeling very self-conscious about the betta fish in the
backseat of my car — the one that I bought at the pet store for Pat an hour
ago — and the comic books for Coog, and the sweatshirt for Tom, and all
the presents I bought for my friends on this day. I know that Pat is right. It’s
strange that I’ve done this, but it’s been a long time since I’ve had a good
Christmas, and I want this one to be special.
The combination of my unending childhood poverty , my absentee
mother and my evil stepfather , and their now failing marriage, has made
every Christmas for years a misery. But for the first time in my life, I have
money in my pocket. I’m a manager at McDonald’ s making $5.75 an hour.
I’m working full-time while I’m in high school, and I am the richest person
I know . I am going to use this money to buy myself a great Christmas.
I’m heading home now. I need to get my uniform, because I have a shift
at McDonald’ s later and I need to get these presents into the house. I need
to get the betta fish out of the cold. It’s starting to snow out. It’s kind of
lovely . I’m driving my mother ’s 1976 Datsun B210, a car about the size of a
box of Pop-T arts, through the town of Mendon, Massachusetts. The lawns
of each home are turning white. It’s the first snowfall of the year. As I drive
by each house, it’s as if I’m passing a picture postcard of Chris tmas. I feel
this might be a good Christmas after all.
I’m coming around a corner and I’m heading down a hill when my car
starts sliding to the opposite lane on the snowy road. I look up, and I see a
white Mercedes-Benz coming right at me.
They say that in moments like this, time will slow down or even freeze,
and it is absolute ly true. In the three seconds it takes before our two cars hit
head-on, I have exactly three thoughts.
The first is: I’m not wearing my seat belt. I always wear my seat belt,
but in the excit ement of buying Christmas presents and the rush to get
home, I’ve for gotten to put it on, on the worst day of my life to for get.
My second thought is: in mome nts like this, I’ve been told to steer into
the skid, but it occurs to me now that I don’t know what the hell that really
means. (I still don’ t know to this day .)
My third thought is just one sentence, it’s five words long, and I say it
aloud: “This is going to suck.”
And it does. When our cars collide, I’m thrown forward, and my head
crashes through the windshield.  My chin catches the steering wheel on the
way, and the entire bottom row of my teeth comes flying out and into the
back of my mouth in one large chunk. At the same moment, my legs come
forward, and my right leg becom es embedded down to the bone in the air-
conditioning unit. My left leg hits the emer gency release brake, knocking
the handle off and skewering my left leg. My chest crashes into the steering
wheel, breaking ribs and knocking all the air from my lungs. It’s all over in
a second. Then shock descends upon me, and I feel no pain or fear .
I climb out of the car . I’m sort of crumpled next to the car , half standing,
half crouching, when I see the woman in the Mercedes get out. She’s
completely unha rmed. Her seat belt and the size of her car have protected
her completely . Then she sees me, vomits, and passes out.
The first to arrive at the scene is a pickup truck full of teenagers. A kid
about my age gets to me first. He lies me down in the mud and the snow on
the side of the road. He gives me a look over, and then he crouches close to
my ear and whispers, “Dude, you’re fucked.”
It is the most accurate medical assessment that I will receive that day .
A police of ficer arrives and puts a coat on me to keep me warm. I’ve got
broken ribs, so it feels like a thousand pounds. I’m looking up at a white
sky, and the snow is really starting to fall now , so I close my eyes.
When I open my eyes again, I’m in an ambulance. A young woman is
straddling my hips and she is pounding on my chest, which is now on fire.
There’ s a man trying to shove a clear tube down my throat, and the woman
starts screaming, “He’ s back! He’s back!” And I’m wondering, “Who the
hell is back?”
It’s me. I’m back. I’ll find out later that my heart stopped beating and I
stopped breathing for about a minute.
No white light.
Now I’m in the emer gency room, and the doctors get to work on me
right away. They’re picking out glass from my forehead with tweezers.
They’re getting my legs ready for surgery. Dental surgeons wire that chunk
of teeth back down into my jaw . It’s the most painful thing I’ve ever felt.
A nurse  comes over and asks me for my phone number . My clothes
were cut off at the scene, so I have no ID. I give her my parents’ number ,
and then I give her the number for McDonald’ s because I’m supposed to be
working that night. She sort of scoffs at this and looks at me as if I’m crazy ,
which I kind of am. I was dead  twenty minutes ago and now I’m worried
about work, but that drive-through does not run well witho ut me, and
they’re going to have to get someone in.
Bless her heart. She makes the call.
As the doctors and nurses work on me, I notice that their expressions
begin to change. I see it, becau se I am thinking the same thing they are:
Where the hell are my parents?
I’ll find out later that when they heard I was in stable conditi on, they
went to check the car out first. I won’ t see them before sur gery.
I’m waiting for a sur geon, because it’ s December 23, and they’re hard to
find. I’m waiting and waiting and waiting, and I’m feeling as alone as I’ve
ever felt.
But I’m not alone, because when the nurse called McDonald’ s to tell
them about the accident, the manager on duty told my friends, and those
friends started calling other friends. An old-fashioned phone tree begins,
with friends calling friends calling friends, and the waiting room is now
filling up with sixteen- and seventeen- and eighteen-year -old kids in ripped
jeans and concert T-shirts, and one fourteen-year -old boy who is cooler than
all of them. And my friend Bengi is the first one to arrive.
They can’t come into the emer gency room to see me, because they’re
not family , but when the nurses realize that my parents won’ t be arriving in
time, they roll my gurney to the other side of the emer gency room, and they
open a door. One by one, each of my friends stands in the doorway . And
they wave. And they give me the thumbs-up. The boys say incredibly
inappropriate things to make me laugh, and the girls tell me that they love
me, and I can hear them chanting my name as I am rolled into the operating
room.
None of the presents ever make it into my friend’ s hands. Bengi never
gets his concert T-shirt and Coog never gets his comic books, and the betta
fish is the only fatality in the accident that day .
But it turns out that Pat is wrong. You can give your friends surprise
Christmas presents, because they give me the best one I’ve ever received.
They give me family , and until I meet my wife fifteen years later, they are
the only family that I have. And it turns out they’re the only family that I
need.
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Secret to the Big Story: Make
It Little
“This Is Going to Suck”  is what I call a big story . When  you are brought
back to life in the back of an ambulance, that’ s big.
Here’ s the surprising thing: despite what most people think, these are
the hardest stories to tell. You’d think that a head-on collision, dying, and
coming back to life would be easy to tell about, full of high stakes, drama,
and excitement, but remember:
The goal of storytelling is to connect with your audience, whether it’s
one person at the dinner table or two thousand people in a theater .
Storytelling is not about a roller-coaster ride of excitement. It’s about
bridging the gap between you and another person by creating a space of
authenticity , vulnerability , and universal truth.
If this is the goal (and it should be), then the big stories can get in the
way of connecting. I cannot connect with most people on the level of a
near-death experience. Audiences don’t listen to me describ e my head
crashing through a windshield and think, “Yes, I remember the time my
head went through a windshield, and yes, I also subsequently died on the
side of the road. I feel for you, Matt.”
Big stories are hard stories to tell, because the big parts of these stories
are often singular in nature. Unusual. Unique. Hardly relatable . This holds
true for all my big stories.
When I’m twelv e years old, I’m stung by a bee. When the paramedics
find me in my dining room, my heart is not beating, and I’m not breathing.
When I’m fourteen years old, firefighters awaken me in the middle of
the night and carry me from our burning home.
When I’m twenty-two years old, I’m interrogated, arrested, jailed, and
tried for a crime I did not commit.
That same year, a gun is pressed to my head and the trigger is pulled
multiple times in order to get me to open a safe in the back of a
McDonald’ s.
When I’m thirty-six years old, an anonymous person or persons
excerpts ten years of my blog posts, using out-of-context and seemingly
inflammatory comments to create a thirty-seven-page packet that argues
that I am not fit to teach child ren and compares me to the Virginia Tech
killer . It’s sent to the mayor , town council, school board, and more than
three hundred families in my school district, demanding my immediate
termination, as well as the termination of my wife and my principal, and
threatens that the packet will go to the press if action is not taken.
These experiences sound like amazing (and unfortunate) stories,  and yet
each story took a long time for me to finally tell. Ultimately none of them
are about what they appear to be.
The story of my beesting is really the story of the death of my mother ,
and of my hope that we might still be connected, even though she is no
longer alive.
The story of firefighters rescuing me from my home is really about the
greatest “I told you so” of my life.
The story of my arrest is really the story of my struggle with faith and of
an unexpected plea to the Almighty , and the story of my subseq uent jailing
is really about missing a second date with a girl I liked a lot.
The story of the robbery is really the story of my ongoing, persistent
existential crisis and its impact on my relationship to my children.
The story of the attempt to destroy my reputation and get me fired is
really the story of the power of the anonymous assailant but the greater
power of public support.
And the story of my car acciden t and near-death experience, as I’m sure
you know by now, is not about  the accident or my experience  at all. I’ve
received hundreds of emails from people all over the country  about that
story , which The Moth has aired on their Radio Hour more than once.
Never has a person written, “I love the story of your car accident” or “I love
the story of your near -death experience.”
Instead it’s always “I loved the story of the emer gency room” or “I love
the story of your friends in the waiting room.”
I die in my story , and yet that momentary brush with death is neither the
most important nor the most interesting thing that happens. It’s almost
forgotten by the end. The accid ent is simply the means by which I get my
audience into the emer gency room. It’s the equivalent of the disintegrated
tire in “Charity Thief.” It’s the thing that happens that gets me to where the
story really takes place.
In fact, now that you know how stories work, you should realize that
“This Is Going to Suck” could never be about my near-death experience,
because I never experienced it. I closed my eyes on the side of a road
because the snow was fallin g, and sometime after that I became
unconscious and died.
But I had no idea that I was going to stop breathing. I had no idea that
my heart would stop beating. How could I possibly experie nce a five-
second moment  of transformation or realization if I didn’ t know it was
happening?
The same thing had happene d five years earlier , when I stopped
breathing and my heart stopped beating on my dining-room floor following
the beesting. I closed my eyes, drifted into unconsciousness, and died. But I
never saw it coming.
Even if I had seen them coming, I still wouldn’ t have made either story
about my near-death experience , because it’s incredibly hard to connect to
people through death. Most of us have never experienced it before. Most of
us have never awakened in the midst of someone administering CPR on us.
This is the trick to telling a big story: it cannot be about anyth ing big.
Instead we must find the small,  relatable, comprehensible mom ents in our
larger stories. We must find the piece of the story that people can connect
to, relate to, and understand.
You need to find the story of the man who learns to love children among
the man-eating dinosaurs so he can be with the woman he loves.
You need to find the story of the scientist who finds faith in a higher
power among the Nazis and snakes and enormous rolling boulders.
You may never understand what it’s like to crash your head through a
windshield, but you’ve probably been let down or ignored or forgotten by a
loved one, as I was in that emer gency room.
You probably understand what it feels like to be alone at a moment of
need.
You’ve probably experienced the fear of hospitals and sur gery.
You probably know what it’s like to be picked up off the ground and
saved at the most unlikely moment by the most unexpected figure.
My story  isn’t about a car accide nt or a near-death experience. It’s about
my friends standing in the place of my family when I need them most.
That’ s it.
When I tell “This Is Going to Suck” in theaters or workshops or even at
the dinner table, audience mem bers cry almost every time, but no one has
ever cried at my description of the accident. Despite the brutality and horror
of that collision, audience members have never shed tears at the pain and
violence that I suffered. They wince. They groan. They shake their heads in
pity. But never tears.
They cry, of course, when they hear that my friends are filling the
waiting room outside the emer gency room, and when those doors open and
my frien ds are standing there, cheering me on, even I have a hard time not
crying.
Honestly , there are tears in my eyes as I write these words.
Little moments hidden inside big moments. That’ s what we need  to find
to tell a big story well.
Big stories need  not contain as much violence, death, or drama as mine
do. Hopefully they don’t. Remember: my friends told me that I’ve lived the
worst life ever. Not true, of course, but I hope your life hasn’ t been as
chaotic or violent as mine.
Your big stories could be about a vacation to exotic locales or the birth
of a child or your wedding day or the untimely death of a loved one. Any of
these could be told well if you find a way to make the story smaller than it
seems. This is hard to do. Rarely are stories of birth or death or weddings or
vacations good. They are more often ordinary , expected, and boring. Cliché.
But this need not be the case.
I tell a story about the birth of my son, Charlie. It’s a humoro us story
about how the supposed beauty  of childbirth is anything but beautiful. It’s
ugly, harrowing, bloody , and in the case of Charlie’ s birth, dangerous. A
placental abruption had raised the stakes considerably .
Still, that’s not what the story  was about, because few people can
connect with a potentially life-threatening birth. Most people (including
me) don’ t really know what a placental abruption is.
Instead it’s a story about expectations. It’s about what parents and
doctors and society tell you to expect from childbirth (beauty and light and
joy) versus the reality .
It’s also a story about how this belief — that childbirth is not pretty —
was upended by my daughter . Clara, who was three years old at the time
and was convinced that we were having a girl. For nine months, she made
plans for tea parties, dance recitals, and dress-up parties. She wanted a sister
so badly . Despite our constant reminders that the baby might be a boy, she
refused to accept this possibility .
When I told Clara that Charlie  was a boy shortly after his birth, she
collapsed in wails of genuine agony and sadness. Just as it was for me, this
birth was anything but expected  for her. But I scooped her up, carried her
over to the bed where Elysha was holding Charlie, and I introduced her to
her brother . Clara looked down on Charlie, and without warning , this ball of
rage and anger melted in my arms, and she fell instantly in love with him.
It was the first and only time in my life that I witnessed love at first
sight. I will never forget it. It was the beauty of childbirth that I never
expected to see.
That is what the story is about. Not a step-by-step accoun ting of
Charlie’ s birth or the harrowing potential of a placental abruption, but a
look into the horror and the beauty of the unexpected. A little moment
hiding within a big event.
A friend and fellow storyteller named Monica Cleveland tells the story
about a plane crash that she experienced a few years ago. She was in a
seaplane that landed exceedingly hard on water , damaging the plane,
rapidly flooding it, and sending it to the bottom of the lake. Even after they
escape the plane, they are in the mountains, swimming through an
exceptionally cold lake, wondering how long it will be before anyone
realizes that they are missing and mounts a search and rescue.
It’s a plane crash , on water no less, but it’s really a story about Monica’ s
anxiety-plagued daughter . Monica realized that if she told her daughter the
truth about the crash, her daughter might never fly again. So instead of a
harrowing tale of near death in the air and on the water , Mon ica tells the
story of a mother trying to frame her own near-death expe rience into
something less frightening for the benefit of her child. She turns it into an
adventure story so that her daughter isn’t paralyzed by fear for the rest of
her life.
It’s a story of a mother ’s worry and love instead of a plane crash. The
plane crash is like my car accident or the blown-out tire on my Chevy
Malibu: simply a means to getting to what really matters.
The best thing about big stories  is that most people don’t have many of
them. This is good, because they really are hard to tell.
I have yet to tell the story of my trial for the crime I did not commit.
I have yet to tell the story of the fellow drummer at band camp who had
his leg blown open by the backfiring of a school bus.
I haven’ t told the story of my pet raccoon, Racket, or the time I agreed
to a $15,000 surgery for my dog while sleepwalking, or the time I escaped
the police in an exceedingly brief but very real high-speed chase. I haven’ t
told the story of my brother ’s return from what we thought was the dead
after he had disappeared for more than five years.
All big stories. Why haven’ t I told them?
They are hard to tell.
It’s taken almost two years for Monica to finally tell her airpla ne-crash
story . Instead she’s told stories  about an incredibly awkward second date
and a Christmas morning when she felt like the worst mother in the world.
Why? Plane-cra sh stories are hard to tell. Long, silent, awkwa rd dates
and parental missteps are stories that audiences connect to more easily .
They are easier to tell.
I’d much  rather tell you the story of the time I danced with Clara to the
Ramones in the dying light of a summer day and learned some thing about
regret. Or the time I swallowed a penny as a little boy and couldn’ t tell my
parents. Or the time Elysha said to me (at least a month befor e we started
dating), “If we start dating, we’ll never break up. We’ll get married and be
together forever .”
Smaller moments, to be sure. Tiny, even. Moments no one would have
recognized had they witnessed them firsthand. But they are easier to tell and
just as good as the big moments. Maybe better .
STORY BREAK
Brevity Is the Soul of Wit
One of my favorite church signs that I’ve ever seen says: “Come hear our
pastor . He’ s not very good, but he’ s quick.”
In storytelling, you should always try to say less. Shorter is better .
Fewer words rule. The twenty-minute commencement address is almost
always better than the forty-mi nute address. The thirty-minute meeting is
almost always more ef fective than the sixty-minute meeting. The six-minute
story is almost always better than the ten-minute story . And yes, the shorter
sermon is always better than the longer sermon.
As Blaise Pascal first said, “If I had more time, I would have written
you a shorter letter .” Brevity takes time, because brevity is always better .
The longer you speak, the more engaging, amusing, and captiva ting you
must be. That’ s a tall order . Those are high expectations. Most people are
not engaging, amusing, or captivating by nature.
But that’s okay . As the sign says, you don’t have to be nearly as good if
you can be quick . Shorter is also harder . I often tell storytellers that it’s easy
to tell an eight- to ten-minute story . Almost anyone can find a way to get
from beginning to end in ten minutes.
But it’s hard to tell a five- to six-minute story . It means making difficult
choices about what will stay and what will go. It requires careful crafting
and clever construction. Words and phrases must be expertly manipulated.
Your choices must be spot-on. But the results are often superior .
One of the most popular stories that I tell is about four minutes long.
Although the story is good and actually won a Moth StorySLAM, I remain
convinced that audiences like it because it’s short. I pack a ton of suspense
and humor and heart into four minutes, making the story seem exceedingly
satisfying.
I could easily turn that four-minute gem into a longer , more complex
story , and I nearly did when The Moth asked me to tell it on their
Mainstage. I began expanding the story , finding areas to explore in more
depth, and while the results would have been excellent, I think the pace and
hilarity of the story might have suf fered greatly .
Ultimately , we decided on a different story for that show , so I never had
the chance to see the results of the longer story . But here is what I know:
The longer you speak, the more perfect and precise you must be. The
longer you stand in front of an audience — whether it be a theater or a
boardroom — the more entertaining and engaging your words must be.
So speak less. Make time your ally .
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
There Is Only One Way to Make
Someone Cry
I’ve made my wife cry  twice in my life.
On December 28, 2004, Elysh a and I ascended the stairs in Grand
Central Station, her self-described favorite room in the world. When we
reached the top of the staircase, I pulled her to a stop. A police officer
appeared almost instantly and told us to keep moving. “You’re blocking the
stairs,” she said.
I dropped to one knee.
“Oh,” the of ficer said. She smiled and stepped back.
I was holding a book that I had been reading on the train. Wanting to
take Elysha’ s hands in my own, I turned and handed the book to the police
officer. “Hold this,” I whispered. The of ficer nodded and smiled.
I turned back to Elysha. Tears were already filling her eyes. “Elysha
Green,” I said. “W ill you marry me?”
Tears ran down her cheeks as I removed the jewelry box from my coat
pocket and lifted the lid, presenting her with an engagement ring. She wept
as I put it on her finger .
A second later, shouts erupted  from the bottom of the stairs. About
twenty-five of our friends, hiding in the holiday crowd, had witnessed the
proposal firstha nd. When they burst into cheers, they were immediately
surrounded by National Guard  soldiers. The country was on alert level
extra-super -ultra-orange, and the soldiers were on high alert. One of my
friends, a police officer, quickly  defused the situation, and our principal and
friend Plato, who would serve as the minister at our wedding two years
later, charged up the stairs first, taking two and three steps at a time. He was
pumping his fist in the air and cheering.
Elysha saw him first. Still weeping, she said, “Plato? What are you
doing here?”
Soon we were surrounded by friends and family congratulating  us. We
all went to lunch and then walked to Rockefeller Center as snow began to
fall so we could pose for photos underneath the Christmas tree.
For the record, Elysha never said yes to my proposal of marriage. She
only cried. T o this day , I’m still waiting for an answer .
The second time I made Elysh a cry was about two years later. I was
sitting at my desk, correcting papers alongside a student-teach er when my
phone rang. I rarely receive calls during the school day, but since my
students were in art class, I picked up the phone to see who was calling. A
California number .
“That’ s weird,” I said to my student-teacher . “Who lives in California?”
I answered the call. It was my literary agent, calling to tell me that
Doubleday had made an offer on my first novel, Something Missing . I
didn’ t even know that she had sent the book to publishers.
It was an offer for more money than I had ever seen in my life. More
money than I could ever have imagined for a story that I had made up in my
head. She explained the specifics of a deal. Negotiations were still ongoing.
She wanted to retain international rights. But the basics of the deal were in
place. The book was sold. I listened in disbelief. When I finally hung up the
phone, I was shaking.
“What?” my student-teacher asked.
“I can’ t tell you,” I told her . “Elysha has to be first.”
I ran to Elysha’ s classroom, only one door down from my own, but the
room was empty . Her students were in music class. She was somewhere in
the building. So began my frantic search through the school for my wife.
As I ran past the office, Plato saw me. “What’ s wrong?” he asked,
looking worried.
“Can’ t say,” I said. “Elysha first.”
I ran into Cindy and Justine, two women who had served as bridesmaids
in our wedding the previous year. “What’ s your deal?” Cindy asked as I
charged past them.
“Not now ,” I said.
I checked the lunchroom. The copy room. The music room. I finally
found Elysha in a hallway behind the auditorium. “What’ s up, honey?” she
asked.
“Stop,” I said. I took her by the shoulders. “Just listen.” I told her the
news. I had spoken about two sentences when she collapsed to the floor in
tears. The money wasn’ t going to make us rich by any stretch of the
imagination, but it was enough to clear our wedding debts and enable us to
put a down payment on a home. She cried and cried and cried.
Word quickly spread throughou t the school that I had broken up with
Elysha in the back hall of the school. After setting the record straight, we
celebrated.
That’ s it. I’ve made her cry a total of two times in our almost fifteen years
together . This is not to say that she hasn’ t cried at other times over the
course of our relationship. She cried throughout most of our wedding
ceremony . She wept at the birth  of both of our children. She cried upon the
death of each of our two cats, Jack and Owen. She often gets teary-eyed
while watching movies and telev ision. Commercials can make her cry. José
Saramago’ s novel Blindness  made her weep almost constantly .
But when it comes to me, I’ve only made her cry twice. Why? And
more importantly , how?
The answer is simple: surprise.
With my marriage proposal and the publication of my first novel, I
surprised Elysha with unexpected information. Joyous information, but
completely unanticipated.
When it comes to storytelling, I believe that surprise is the only way to
elicit an emotional reaction from your audience. Whether it’ s laughter , tears,
anger , sadness, outrage, or any other emotional response, the key is
surprise.
This is unlike real life, where many things can give rise to an emotional
reaction, and surprise is not always required.
Like Elysha, I cried at the birth  of each of our children, not because of
surprise (though we waited to be surprised about the sex of each child) but
because I was overwhelmed by the instantaneous love I felt for these two
new human beings.
Like Elysha, I cried at the death  of our cats. I was overcome with grief
and sadness for these two beautiful boys who gave us so much love and
affection for so many years.
I frequently leap into the arms  of total strangers in Gillette Stadium
when the Patriots win a close game or score an especially awe-inspiring
touchdown. This is almost alwa ys the result of a prolonged period of hope,
anticipation, nervousness, and excitement.
I wept throughout much of my mother ’s funeral. I was overcome by the
personal loss as well as by the knowledge that she would never  read one of
my books or meet any of my children.
Elysha doesn’ t know this, but I recently wept in pain over a wisdom
tooth that had cracked wide open. The nerve was exposed, but because of
bad timing, I had to wait five days for surgery. In the middle of the night,
the pain became so unbearab le (even with the Vicodin) that I crept
downstairs to cry . I didn’ t want to worry her .
In real life, there  are many reasons to experience an emotional response.
But in storytelling, we don’ t have the ability to overwhelm an audience with
grief. We can’t create prolonged periods of nervousness or excitement. We
can’t cause physical pain. We can’t recreate these depths of experience. All
we have is words. We must use our words strategically to create and
enhance surprise for our audience.
Think about the moments of emotional response in “This Is Going to
Suck.” All of them are generated through surprise.
Audiences react with shock and sympathy when my car collides head-
on with the Mercedes, mostly because, as terrible as they suspect a head-on
collision can be, they don’t expect to discover that my entire bottom row of
teeth would be knocked to the back of my mouth or that my head would
crash through the windshield. They don’t think my legs would be as
ravaged as they are. It’s a surprise. As bad as they may have predicted the
accident to be, it’s rare for someone to expect this level of violence and
gore.
I enhanc e this surprise through contrast. I paint a very different picture
of the world right before the collision. I talk about my hopes for a perfect
Christmas. I describe the picture postcard–like appearance of the homes that
I pass. I turn the snow , which will prove to be the cause of my downfall,
into something beautiful, blanke ting the lawns in white. All of this is done
specifically to enhance the surprise of the collision. I’m creating contrast
between the moment just before  the collision and the moment immediately
after. I’m establishing expectations so I can quickly upend them.
Audiences beco me emotional and often cry upon learning that my
friends have filled the waiting room outside the emer gency room, because
this is also a surprise. They never see it coming. Part of the reason is that I
hide important information in the story (more on this in a moment), but it’s
also because I accentuate the surprise by stressing the idea that I am alone. I
paint the picture of a boy who is badly hurt and completely alone in a place
where no one even knows his name. I’ve primed the audience for an
emotional response by playing upon their sympathy , empathy , and outrage.
My parents decide to check on the car before checking on me.
The nurses don’ t know my name.
It’s two days before Christmas.
I feel utterly alone.
When I say the words, “But I’m not alone, because . . .” audience
members will sometimes start crying even before they hear the reason. I’ve
primed the pump for surprise.
Audiences also laugh several times during “This Is Going to Suck,”
even though it’s not a funny story at all, and in each of these cases, the
laughter is an emotional response resulting from a surprise. I’ll explain each
of these moments in the next chapter on humor .
How to Ruin Surprise
For you as a storyteller , this means that you need to build surpri se into your
stories. There must be moments of unexpectedness so that your audience
can experience an emotional response to your story .
You may argue that I was able to surprise my audience in “This Is
Going to Suck” because my story had surprises already built in. Head-on
collision. Death. Friends suddenly appearing in the waiting room.
But this is not true. I will grant that the story contains moments of
potential surprise, but almost every story ever told has this kind of potential.
It’s up to the storyteller to ensure that these moments are as surprising as
possible.
Storytellers often mitigate or even ruin surprise by making some simple
mistakes or failing to accentua te or enhance the potential surprise of the
moment.
Common mistakes that storytellers make that ruin surprise include:
Presenting a thesis statement prior to the surprise.
This often takes the form of an opening sentence that gives away all that is
surprising about the story .
“This is a story about a time in my life when my friends became my
family .”
“This is a story about a car accident so serious that it took my life, if
only for a moment.”
“This is the story of a waiting room full of surprise guests.”
It sounds ridiculous, I know , but this is done all the time, both onstage
and in less formal situations. People feel the need to open their stories with
thesis statements, either in an effort to grab the audience’ s atten tion with a
loaded statement or (more likely) because this is how they were taught to
write in school: thesis stateme nt, followed by supporting evidence and
details.
But storytelling  is the reverse of the five-paragraph essay . Instead of
opening with a thesis statement and then supporting it with evidence,
storytellers provide the evidence first and then sometimes offer the thesis
statement later only when necessary . This is how we allow for surprise.
The same holds true for smaller moments of surprise within stories. For
example, in describing the way my grandmother pulled my teeth, I have
two choices:
Option #1
My grandmother tied a length of string around my loose tooth. She
leaned in close so our two faces  were just inches apart. She told me to look
her straight in the eyes. “Don’ t blink,” she warned. Then she wrapped the
other end of the string around her fist, raised it between our noses, smiled,
and pulled down. Hard.
My grandmother was a sadist.
Option #2
My grandmother was a sadist.
She tied a length  of string aroun d my loose tooth. She leaned in close so
our two faces were just inches apart. She told me to look her straight in the
eyes. “Don’t blink,” she warned. Then she wrapped the other  end of the
string around her fist, raised it between our noses, smiled, and pulled down.
Hard.
See the differen ce? In option #1, the thesis statement comes at the end of
the paragraph, allowing for my grandmother ’s method of pulling my teeth
to be as surprisi ng as possible. That thesis statement “My grandmother was
a sadist” also probably adds a laugh at the end to punctuate the moment.
Referring to any grandmother as a sadist is surprising. These two words
are rarely pushed together , and therefore the statement, if delivered well, is
probably funny .
Option #2 strips the moment of its potential surprise. It alerts the
audience to the horror that is coming. “My grandmother was a sadist.” The
audience knows  that whatever follows will not be pretty . The actual method
of tooth removal may still be surprising, but not nearly as much as in option
#1.
Thesis statements ruin the surprise every time. In storytelling, our job is
to describe action, dialogue, and thought. It is never our job to summarize
these things.
Failing to take advantage of the power of stakes to enhance and
accentuate surprise.
Remember in “Charity Thief” when I put a Backpack on my audience
before I enter that gas station? I describe my plan for begging for gas in
great detail. It sounds like a plausible idea. Probable, even. My audience is
rooting for me. They expect me to get the gas I need. I know this because
when I tell this story in workshops, I see the same reaction every  time I say,
“But the kid won’ t give me the gas.”
Shoulders slump. Faces contort in anger . People groan. They shake their
heads in disgust. They experience an emotional reaction very similar to the
one I experienced that day .
Why? They are surprised. They wanted my plan to work. They expected
it to work. It sounds like something that should have worked.
If I don’t expla in my plan before I enter the gas station, no one is
surprised if the kid says no. He should say no. Who gives away free gas?
It’s only when I load up my audience with a complete descrip tion of my
plan, as well as all my hopes and dreams, that they experience the surprise
of the refusal.
The same thing happens later in that story , when I say, “Hi, I’m Matt,
and I’m collecting money for Ronald McDonald Children’ s Charities.” It’s
the most surprising moment of the story . People either gasp or laugh when
they hear me say those words. If you’ll remember , I accentuate this surprise
with a Breadcrumb and an Hour glass. I give a hint about what is to come (a
crumpled McDonald’ s uniform), and I make the audience wait forever to
hear it by slowin g my speech and adding enormous amounts of unnecessary
description and repetition.
Can you imagin e how less surprising the moment would be if I had
climbed into my car, spotted the crumpled McDonald’ s uniform, and said,
“I know . I’m going to go door-to-door pretending to be a charity worker .”
Still surprising, perhaps, but not nearly so.
Yet this is what many storytellers do. Rather than seeking ways to make
the surprise even more surprisin g, they kill the surprise through  a failure to
accentuate it. They fail to take advantage of the power of stakes to make
something that is potentially surprising truly surprising.
Failing to hide critical information in a story .
As story tellers, we must hide pertinent information from our audiences to
allow the surprise to pay off later. I often refer to this as planting a bomb in
a story that will explode when the time is right.
In “This Is Goin g to Suck,” the bomb that I plant is the moment that I
ask the nurse to call McDonald’ s to tell my manager that I can’t make it to
work. This is important. It’s critical to the story . It’s the reason why my
friends know about the accident and make their way to the emer gency
room. But I don’t want my audience to foresee these events, so I hide this
important moment in two ways:
Hiding the Bomb in the Clutter
We hide these important moments by making them seem unimportant. We
do this by hiding critical infor mation among other details. We make the
important infor mation seem no more important than the rest of the
information by pushing it all together .
In the case of “This Is Going to Suck,” I turn my all-important request
for the nurse to call McDonald’ s into just another detail by placing it amid a
series of doctors’ and nurses’ interactions with me. Rather than highlighting
the encounter , I add it to a long list:
Nurses picking glass fr om my for ehead
Dental sur geons wiring teeth
Doctors pr epping my knees for sur gery
A nurse asking for contact information
See what I did? It’s a critical moment in the story , essential to all that is
to come, but I portray the nurse as just another medical profess ional doing
another job. Oftentimes I will load a portion of a story with superfluous
information simply to hide the one important bit of information  that I need
the audience to know but not yet recognize as important. I clutter the
landscape so that the audience can’ t tell what is important and what is not.
Camouflage
I also camouflage the bomb  within a laugh. Laughter is the best
camouflage, because it is also an emotional response, and audience
members assume that the laugh is the result of the storyteller ’s wanting to
be funny .
This is never the case. Comedians want to be funny . Great storytellers
want to be reme mbered. For this reason, they deploy laughter strategically .
I’ll talk more about this in the next chapter , but when it comes to preserving
surprise, laughter is an excellent way to hide something important that
needs to surprise the audience later on.
In “This Is Going to Suck,” I ask the nurse to call McDonald’ s (a fact I
want to hide), so then I say, “[The nurse] looks at me as if I’m crazy , which
I kind of am. I was dead twent y minutes ago and now I’m worried about
work, but that drive-through does not run well without me, and they’re
going to have to get someone in.”
That laugh line draws attention away from the importance and relevance
of this moment.  It makes the moment feel like a storyteller ’s attempt at a
joke instead of the conveying of a critical bit of information.
This is an exceptionally important concept in storytelling. If you can’t
hide critical details and preserve the surprise, the audience sees it coming a
mile away . In that case, you may as well not even tell your story .
A couple of examples:
I tell a story about the time my girlfriend’ s father surprised  me by
serving me my pet rabbit on Thanksgiving.
When I’m twenty years old, Bengi and I decide to buy a pair of rabbits
and keep them in the house as pets in hopes that girls would think this sweet
and like us more.
It kind of works . Girls come over to see the rabbits and hang out for the
rest of the day. I don’t know if they like me more, but they hang around our
apartment longer and more often, which is great for me. My primary means
of attracting girls has always been proximity . I stand as close to a girl as
possible as long as possible, hoping to wear her down. I crack jokes and tell
stories, and eventually the girl might turn my way .
Sounds silly, I know , but remember this: Elysha fell in love with me
while our classrooms were separated by about twenty-five feet of hallway .
Proximity . It’s genius.
Bengi and I train the rabbits to use a litter box, feed them rabbit food in
cereal bowls, and basically give them the run of the house.
A few months later, the rabbits begin chewing incessantly through the
electrical cords on the TV and lamps, so we decide it’s time for them to
move on. My girlfriend’ s fathe r keeps rabbits in a large hutch behind his
house, so when he hears about my problem, he offers to take them off our
hands. I’m thrilled.
Then he feeds the rabbit to me at Thanksgiving dinner . I didn’ t know it
at the time, but my girlfriend’ s father is Portuguese, and the Portuguese eat
rabbit the same  way I eat chicken. Nor did I realize that my girlfriend’ s
father raised rabbits to sell to local restaurants. To him, a rabbit is nothing
more than a food source.
Still, he knew the rabbit was my pet. He understood the difference. He
thought he was being funny . It was a terrible thing to do.
The trick of the story is to not allow the audience to foresee me eating
my rabbit until the moment I take my first bite of the stew. I need it to be a
surprise. It’ s not easy .
I maintain the surprise in the story by hiding the rabbit in a laundry list
of things  I do to try to impress my girlfriend’ s father , who is manlier than I
will ever be. Bonding over his adoption of my rabbit is just one of many
ways that I try to earn this man’ s respect and admiration and perhaps
become the kind of man I’ve always wanted to be.
I hide the rabbit in the clutter of the story . I make my rabbit just one of
the details (and an amusing one, using laughter as camouflage) instead of
the most important element of the story , which it truly is. So when my
girlfriend’ s fathe r asks, “What do you think about the stew?” the audience
still doesn’ t know that I’m eating my rabbit, because it doesn’ t feel like a
story about a rabbit.
“It’s good,” I say . “I like it.”
My girlfriend’ s father smiles and says, “You should like it because . . .”
That is the mom ent when the audience realizes that I am eating  my rabbit,
just one second before I realized it back in 1991. When I told the story for
the first time, the audience gasped in horror . One of them shouted, “No!
No!”
By hiding the rabbit in the story , and by making it no less obvious than
any other detail, I was able to maintain the surprise and give my audience
the emotional reaction that the story demanded.
In anoth er animal-related story , a couple whose wedding I DJed  decided to
name their dog after me because I was “the most fun person they had ever
met.”
I’m not kidding. It was one of the best days of my life.
By the way, keep in mind that my DJ partner ’s name is Bengi. The
couple could have named their dog after the guy who is named after a dog,
but instead they named their dog after me. I am an objectively fun person.
At the end of the story , Matty the dog unbelievably moves into the
apartment below  mine. Matty the man ends up living above Matty the dog.
What are the odds?
I want my audience to be as surprised as I am when I discover this.
Therefore, like the rabbit, the story can’t be about Matty the dog, and it’s
not. It’s really a story about my pending divorce from my first wife and my
belief that my life is probably over .
When, at the end of the story , Matty the dog arrives at the apartment
below mine, his leash isn’t being held by the bride’ s husband. The groom is
nowhere to be found. Instead she is standing beside the best man from the
wedding.
Yes. She left her husband for the best man, and she took the dog with
her.
It’s a story abou t realizing that perhaps I didn’ t have it so bad after all.
Somewhere in the world, there is a man who has lost his wife, his best
friend, and his dog. Despite my pending divorce, I still had my best friend,
Bengi, and I still had my dog, and maybe, just maybe, I still had a future.
But the story doesn’ t work without surprise. When the dog appears
(along with the bride and best man), you need to be surprised that it’s Matty
the dog. You need to be surprised that it’s the bride. You need to be
surprised that it’ s the best man. Y ou can’ t see any of this coming.
So, as with the rabbits, I hide the dog early in the story as an example of
why I am an objectively fun person even though my ex-wife is complaining
that I am boring. “How can I be boring when a couple named their dog after
me because I am the most fun person they know?”
Just like that, the dog becomes a detail rather than a major plot point. I
tuck the dog in between other details about the problems in our marriage, to
obscure it even further .
I also place the dog early in the story , as far away from the payoff as
possible, and I use that line “The  couple could have named the dog after the
guy who is named after a dog, but instead they named the dog after me” to
punctuate the moment with a laugh, further obscuring the importance that
the dog will play later .
Just a funny detail. Not the most important detail in the whole damn
story .
When I tell the story , the audience realizes that it’s Matty the dog at the
last possible second, only after I’ve identified the woman who is moving
into the apartme nt as the bride.  The dog appears, and the audience smiles,
realizing what’ s happening. Matty the dog is moving in below Matty the
man. This moment usually gets a laugh.
But the surprise s aren’ t over yet, though the audience thinks so. It’s not
until I fail to see the groom but rather spot the best man that the audience
puts two and two together and the laughter quickly transitions into audible
groans. Emotional response achieved by preserving the surprise in the story
and maximizing it to its greatest ef fect.
To review , the strategies for preserving and enhancing surprise in a story:
1.Avoid thesis statements in storytelling.
2.Heighten the contrast between the surprise and the moment just
before the surprise.
3.Use stakes to increase surprise.
4.Avoid giving away the surprise in your story by hiding
important information that will pay off later (planting bombs).
This is done by:
•Obscuring them in a list of other details or examples.
•Placing them as far away from the surprise as possible.
•When possible, building a laugh around them to further
camouflage their importance.
STORY BREAK
The Return of Mathieu
When you stand on a stage in front of hundreds of people and tell a story ,
strange connections can be made.
It’s June 2013. I’m competing in a Moth StorySLAM at The Bitter End.
I’m telling a story about my time student-teaching in Mrs. Rothstein’ s first-
grade class in Berlin, Connecti cut. There was a boy in the class named
Mathieu who refused to listen to a word I was saying. I was working in the
class for about a week, and he had already made me feel stupid. I was
embarrassed about my inability to get a six-year -old boy to obey me. I was
starting to wonder if I was meant to be a teacher .
I was running our morning meeting for the first time, and Math ieu was
once again causing trouble. I finally decided to lay down the law. “If you
don’t stop it, I’m going to call your mother!” I told him.
Mathieu’ s mothe r was dead. She had died earlier that year. I knew this,
but in my fit of anger and embarrassment, I’d for gotten.
I finish telling that story at The Bitter End and return to my seat. During
intermission, a young man appro aches me and says, “I know the Mathieu in
your story!”
“Not possible,” I say .
“No,” he says. “It’s true.” He cites the unusual spelling of the first name
(which was mentioned in the story) and other similarities betwee n his friend
and the Mathieu in my story .
They both lost their mothers in the first grade. They both grew up in
Connecticut. They both behaved badly in elementary school.
“It can’ t be,” I say . “It’s not possible. What are the odds?”
But it was true. A week later, I am exchanging emails with the boy I had
taught fourteen years earlier . I apologize for my stupid and callous remark. I
hope that he didn’ t harbor anger or resentment toward me.
His response: “I don’t remembe r it at all. I don’t really remember you. I
know some man came into our class in first grade for a little while, but then
he left.”
So much for leaving an indelible mark on those kids. Still, my fear that I
had somehow scarred Mathieu  for life was gone. That burden had been
lifted.
I lost the slam  that night to an exceptional storyteller named Kate
Greathead, but for once in my life, winning didn’ t matter . Or almost didn’ t
matter . I lost by a tenth of a point, which always stings. But I had won
something much greater that night.
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Milk Cans and Baseballs, Babies
and Blenders: Simple, Effective
Ways to Be Funny in Storytelling
(Even If You’re Not Funny at All)
First, some hard truth:  I can’t make you a funny person. Many people
(always men) have taken my workshops in the hope that I could teach them
to be funny . I can’ t. I’m not sure if anyone can. But here’ s some good news:
•Stories need not be funny . Though many of my stories have
funny moments, and some are funny throughout much of the
story , they are not all funny .
•Even if you’re not a funny person, you can still craft a story that
contains funny moments.
•Some of your stories will likely be funny even if you’re not
funny at all. I tell the story entitled “Strip Club of My Own
Making” about the time I stripped for a bachelorette party in the
crew room of a McDonald’ s. This is situationally funny , no
matter what I do. The least funny person on the planet can’t
make this story unfunny .
•Stories should never only be funny . The best ones are those that
use humor strategically . Ideally you want your audience to
experience a range of emotions  over the course of your story .
You can’t achiev e this if your audience is laughing for the entire
time.
This is the dif ference between storytelling and stand-up comedy .
Imagine: You attend a fantastic night of stand-up comedy . The next day
your coworker says, “Tell me some of the jokes you heard.” Oftentimes you
can’t.
Maybe you remember bits and pieces of a few, but unless you saw a
comic like Louis C.K., who bases his comedy in storytelling (and was
honored by The Moth for his promotion of it), you can’t reproduce many
jokes, and probably none at all. The comic makes you feel good. You laugh
all night. But the content doesn’ t stick. A week later, you probably won’ t
remember a single thing from the show .
A story , however , can stay with you for the rest of your life. There are
books, movies, television progra ms, and hopefully oral stories that you will
remember until the day you die. There are lots of reasons for this, but one is
that great storytelling isn’t a single thing. Stories aren’ t only funny . The best
ones take you on an emotional journey , always landing somew here in the
heart, and that leaves an indelible mark that stand-up comedy cannot.
Stand-ups want the audience to laugh at all times. Storytellers want the
audience to laugh at the right  times. Humor is an enormous asset in most
stories, but it is not required and should be used strategically whenever
possible.
Let’s consider the humor in “This Is Going to Suck.” The story of my
near-fatal car accident is not funny . No one would ever characterize it as
funny , and yet I use humor four times in the story , in four very strategic
ways, for four very dif ferent reasons:
1. Start with a laugh.
The first time I try to make the audience laugh is at the start of the story .
Audiences usual ly laugh when Pat tells me that “Guys don’t buy Christmas
presents for other guys. Especial ly surprise Christmas presents.”  But even if
they don’t laugh there, they will almost always laugh at the disclosure that I
have also bought a surprise Christmas present for Pat.
I try to make the audience laugh here, because it’s always good to get
your audience to laugh in the first thirty seconds of a story . A laugh at the
beginning does these three things:
1.It signal s to the audience: “I’m a good storyteller . I know what
I’m doing. Y ou can relax.”
2.In a small, less formal situation , this early laugh will serve as a
stop sign for potential interruptions. It serves as an unspoken
signal that you have the floor . In fact, whenever faced with a
person who cann ot stop interrupting, I will often try to make the
people around us laugh (never at the expense of the interrupter)
to reassert my control over the space. “I made them laugh. I’ve
got the floor . Let me finish, damn it.”
3.An early laugh lets the audience know that regardless of how
serious, intense, or disturbing the story I am telling may be, I’m
okay now. “I made you laugh. Everything is fine. Whateve r
horror I’m about to tell you about, it’ s in the past.”
This last thing is important when you’re telling an especially difficult
story . The story of the armed robbery in a McDonald’ s (“The Robbery”) is
the most difficult story for me to tell, and it’s probably the most difficult
story to hear. A gun is pressed to the side of my head and the trigger is
pulled in an ef fort to get me to open a portion of the safe that is locked.
But I open this story with my children’ s ridiculous, hilarious magic
show . The disappearing-dime trick, for example, features my daughter
telling me and my wife to close our eyes while she make s the dime
disappear . Then, without warning, she violently jams the coin into my ear .
It’s a sweet, funny moment that is relevant (the robbery af fects the way I
see my children to this day), but it’s also intentionally light and joyous. In a
couple of minutes, I’ll be describing how my face is pressed into a greasy
tile floor  as I listen to a man slowly count down to what I think is my death.
The experience will result in two decades of untreated PTSD and an
ongoing existen tial crisis. It’s my darkest story by far. But opening with
something light invites my audience in and lets them know that, as violent
and distu rbing as events are about to become, I have a beautiful,  little girl in
my life who jams dimes into my ears as a part of her magic show . It’s all
good.
An early laugh also provides  the storyteller with an all-important
auditory signal of approval: “Oh, good. My audience likes me. They’re on
my side.” It’ s a fine way to feel as you begin.
In a larger theater , where I often can’t see my audience becaus e of the
glare of the spotlight, that auditory response is especially reassuring. “Oh,
good. The audience is still there. They didn’ t quietly leave while I was
adjusting the microphone.”
Early laughter puts everyone at ease and makes the next few minutes
supremely easier .
2. Make ’em laugh before you make ’em cry .
The second time I make the audience laugh is just before the actual
accident.
Describing my mother ’s car as the size of a box of Pop-T arts often
generates a giggle, but the real laugh comes a few seconds later, when I tell
the audience that I’ve always been told to steer into the skid in situations
like this, but I don’ t know what that means.
I want my audience to laugh here because we are seconds away from
the collision. The contrast between their laughter and the approaching
horror heightens the shocking and visceral nature of what is about to
happen. I often say that I like to make people laugh before making them cry ,
because it hurts more that way .
That is my goal here: Make them  laugh so the collision and the resulting
violence hurt more. Contrast is king in storytelling, and laughter can
provide a fantastic contrast to something authentically awful.
3. Take a breath.
The third time I make the audience laugh is immediately following the
accident. One of the kids from the pickup truck looks me over, leans in, and
whispers, “Dude, you’re fucked.” This almost always causes the audience
to laugh , but I tag the boy’s dialogue with “It is the most accurate medical
assessment that I will receive that day .” Big laugh.
I want my audience to laugh here because they have just endured the
details of a horrific car accident, and I need to break the tension. The
audience needs  to take a breath. Whenever a story has become
exceptionally tense and the audience needs to reset, a laugh is the best way
to do this.
This laugh may seem organic rather than planned. The kid shows up at
the right moment and says the perfect thing to cause a laugh. True, but a lot
of kids show up that day. Anoth er boy places my head on his lap and prays,
telling me not to worry , I’ll see God and Jesus soon, and all will be okay .
Another boy screams uncontrollably upon seeing my legs and needs to be
moved away. A girl weeps besid e me. A lot more happens than is described,
but I strategically choose the one line that has the most potential to be
funny , and it’ s made funny through timing, tonality , and that tag on the end.
That’ s the job of a storyteller . Make good, strategic choices, and then
make the most of those choices.
4. Stop crying so you can feel something else.
The last time I make the audience laugh is near the end of the story , when I
say that the betta fish is the only fatality of the accident. This laugh is
another opportun ity for the audience to take a breath and reset. Many begin
crying upon learning that my friends are piling up in the waiting room. I
sometimes do too.
I need the audien ce to collect themselves for the final few lines, because
I know they might cry again. Rather than weeping through the end of the
story , I want them to cry twice, because each time it’s for a slightly different
reason. They first cry upon realizing that my friends are piling into the
waiting room, filling in for parents who should be there. Then they cry
again when I explain, “Pat is wrong. You can give your friends surprise
Christmas presents, because they give me the best one I’ve ever received.”
The audience cries the first time because my friends have arrived when
I needed them most. They cry because they are back in 1988, witnessing
events firsthand.
They cry the second time because I’m reflecting on fifteen years of
having friends fill in for the family I’ve always wanted, and hopefully ,
stating somethin g larger and more universal: People can pick you up when
you’re down. They will fill in the gaps left by others, however large those
gaps may be. Just because your family lets you down doesn’ t mean you’re
alone.
When your audience can feel those two separate and distinct feelings,
separated by a laugh, the potential depth and meaning of the story increases
considerably .
Also, you don’t want your audience weeping for long periods of time.
It’s not pretty .
That’ s it. A story that isn’t funny in any way has four moments of
laughter , all placed in specific ways for strategic reasons.
This is not to say that these are the only reasons for a story to be funny .
Humor is a fantastic tool that can be used to increase the enjoyment of a
story . It can keep an audience engaged. As you learned in the previous
chapter on surprise, humor can serve as camouflage for something
important that must pay off later. Humor can make a storyteller more
likable. Humor is how I managed to get girls to like me for most of my life.
Some stories can’t help but be funny . I tell the story of providing a
semen sample as part of genetic testing entitled “Genetic Flaws.” Going to a
“collection center” in a former -elementary-school-turned-medical-facility to
“make a deposit” is funny no matter how it’s framed. I couldn’ t make it
unfunny if I tried.
I tell the story of stealing left-footed children’ s shoes from a shoe store
during a less-than-daring late-night raid entitled “Shoe Thief.” This is also
unavoidably funny . Stupidity is always hilarious.
But each of these stories also have heart, because that is what stories
must have no matter what. There is more to each of these stories than
simply the laugh. Each one lands on something real.
You must end your story on heart. Far too often I hear storytellers
attempt to end their story on a laugh. A pun. A joke. A play on words. This
is not why we listen to stories. We like to laugh; we want to laugh. But we
listen to stories to be moved.
We love stories that contain mom ents of humor and hilarity . Sometimes
an entire story can be funny . But those last few precious sentences — the
space where you will land your story — should end with heart. Close with
meaning. Stories must conclude with something greater than a laugh.
If you want your story to linger with your audience (and that should be
your goal), you should end in a place that is moving, vulnerable, or
revealing, or establishes connection with the audience.
Save your laugh s for the middle , when you want to keep your audience
engaged. Allow them to carry your audience to the end. But end your story
with something bigger than a laugh.
As I said, I can’t make people funny , no matter how often I am asked to try.
I have yet to figure out that trick, and I may never figure it out. Humor is a
combination of wit, speed, tonality , confidence, daring, nonconformity ,
flexibility with the language, understanding of your audience, and more. In
a lot of ways, it’s all about the way you say something. Deliver y is critical.
It can make the unfunny incredibly funny . Not exactly a bucket of skills that
are easily taught.
But I can help a storyteller add humor to the story . You can at least be
funny within the confines of your story . After that, all bets are of f.
Like all other emotional respon ses (see the previous chapter), humor is
based entirely on surprise. A combination of specific words spoken in a
specific way at a specific mome nt initiates a surprise that sparks a smile, a
giggle, or actual laughter . Like every other emotional response, laughter is
simply a well-cultivated surprise.
The two easiest ways to achiev e these humorous surprises are through
Milk Cans and a Baseball, and Babies and Blenders.
Milk Cans and a Baseball
Milk Cans and a Baseball refers to the carnival game where metallic milk
cans are stacked  in a triangular formation and the player attemp ts to knock
them down with a ball. In comedy , this is called setup  and punch line. The
milk cans repres ent the setup, and the ball is the punch line. The more milk
cans in your tower , the greater potential laugh. The better you deliver the
ball, the more of that potential will be realized. The trick is to work to the
laugh by using language that carefully builds your tower while saving the
funniest thing for last. Sadly , the instinct of most people is to say the
funniest thing first. They can’t wait to get to the funny part, and in doing so,
they ruin it.
For example, in a story entitled “Homeless and the Goat,” I tell the story
about the period of my life when I was homeless. Near the end I say, “I was
rescued from the streets by a family of Jehovah’ s Witnesses. I sleep in a
pantry off their kitchen that they’ve converted into a tiny bedroom. I share
this room with a Jehovah’ s Witness named Rick, a guy who speaks in
tongues in his sleep, and the family’ s indoor pet goat.”
Goat  is the funniest word in that paragraph, because it is the most
unexpected of all the words. It’s the biggest surprise. Therefor e it must be
said last. It is the ball that I use to knock down my tower of milk cans. Can
you see the tower I built before getting there?
Saved by Jehovah’ s Witnesses,  pantry , tiny bedroom, Rick, speaks in
tongues, in his sleep, indoor pet goat.
That’ s a lot of milk cans. Look at those last two words: indoor  and pet. I
chose them with care. I say them slowly , with a definite pause between the
two. I use these words to enhan ce the surprise. When I say indoor  and pet,
my audience is thinking, Dog? Cat? Parakeet? Hamster? Even potbellied
pig is an option. But goat?
Goat  is funny , but it’s only funny when said properly . When my frien ds
tell this story on my behalf, they say things like, “Matt once slept with a
goat. And a guy who talked in his sleep. The guy actually spoke  in tongues
when he was sleeping. They slept in this tiny room off the kitchen of this
family of Jehovah’ s Witnesses.”
They kill the humor. They kill it because they can’t wait to say the word
goat. They kill it because they make no effort to make the goat more than
situationally funny . They kill it by not using the but-and-therefore principle;
the way they tell it is essentia lly with an awful series of ands. I take a
situationally funny moment (I once shared a room with a goat) and make it
into a bigger laugh by manipulating the language around it.
This is the art of Milk Cans and a Baseball. Taking mom ents of
potential humor  and making them as funny as possible. The stack of milk
cans need not be large to genera te a laugh. “A car about the size of a box of
Pop-T arts” also gets a reaction. It’s only a giggle, because the tower of milk
cans isn’ t that tall, but it’ s still a surprise.
“Car about the size of . . .” is my milk can. It establishes an expectation
that whatever is about to follow will be approximately car -size.
Riding lawn mower . Horse. King-size bed. Dining-room table.
All possibly funny , but not as funny as “box of Pop-T arts” becau se “box
of Pop-T arts” is the biggest surprise. I’m comparing a car not to another
vehicle and not to another large item, but to a small container for a food-
like item.
Pop-T art is also a funny word, which only adds to the humor . Some
words are just funny . It’s well known that words with the K sound are
funny . Words like cattywampus , cankles , kuku , caca , and pickle  are funny
just because of that hard K sound (though  I think pickle  is funny even
without the K sound).
Oddly specific words are also funny . It’s funnier for me to say, “I’m
pouring water over Raisin Bran  because I am too stupid and lazy to buy
milk” than it is to say , “I’m pouring water over a bowl of cereal.”
Why? Specificity is funny .
Babies and Blenders
Babies and Blen ders is the idea that when two things that rarely  or never go
together are pushed together , humor often results.
In the story about Elysha discovering that I was hungry as a boy, I
describe Charlie like this:
Except for Charlie’ s obsession with biting his mother ’s ass — an
obsession I can understand quite well — he is the sweetest boy
you’ve ever met. His first complete sentence was “Thank you,
Mama.” When he needs a diaper change, he shouts, “Poop is
here!” When I arrive home at the end of a long workday , Charl ie is
the first and often the only person to greet me at the door. Charlie
oozes love. But when it comes to food, my sweet, angelic, thr ee-year -
old boy is a little asshole.
This always gets a laugh, becau se three-year -old boys are rarely described
as assholes, especially after being described as sweet, angelic, and little.
In the story abou t the way that my grandmother pulled my loose  teeth, I
refer to her as a sadist. Grandmother  and sadist  are rarely seen together , so
it’s funny .
In a story that I tell about swall owing a penny as a boy, I describe the
fireplace that I am sitting in front of when the swallowing happens. It’s a
full-size plastic, plug-in fireplace ordered by my parents through the Sears
catalog. Plastic brick. Plastic wooden mantle. On that faux mantle are
picture frames, and inside those frames are the pictures that were in the
frames when my mother first bought them. A family of white, blond,
smiling people, far better -looking than our own family .
This description always gets a laugh, even though I’m simply describing
the truth. It’s funny because fireplaces are not supposed to be plastic and
plug-in and ordered through mail-order catalogs, and picture frames
shouldn’ t be filled with magazine models. All of these incongruities are
jammed together and generate laughs.
Would I describe the fireplace  in such detail if it didn’ t generate a
laugh? Probably  not. But the description comes at the beginning of the
story , and you know how valuable a laugh can be at the beginning of a
story .
My favorite example of Babies  and Blenders is an old Sesame Street
game called “One of These Thin gs Is Not Like the Other .” Storytellers play
this game in their stories all the time by creating a list of three descriptors,
with the third being nothing like the other two. My favorite storyteller in the
world — Steve Zimmer — does this in a story entitled “Neighborhood
Watch.” After Steve’ s family is not invited to the neighborhoo d Hawaiian
luau, they decide to host the Zimmer family barbecue, which features
“Zimmers, pineapple-flavored ham, and despair .”
One of those things is not like the others, and the result is a big laugh.
These are not the only two ways to create humor in a story . There are
others, of course. But I would ar gue that almost all humor boils down to one
of these two strategies, and really down to surprise.
Exaggeration is another form of Babies and Blenders. We push an
unreasonable description against something that doesn’ t normally fit that
description, and a laugh is the result. But this only works when everyone
agrees that you’re exaggerating. If I’m falsely exaggerating in the attempt
to make my audience believe that my exaggeration is accurate, that is not an
exaggeration. It is a lie — an unacceptable one in my book.
When I tell my audience that my Jewish wife picked out her first
Christmas tree, and it was “seven feet wide and three feet tall,” everyone
knows this is an exaggeration. No one believes that the tree was really
seven feet wide and three feet tall. Therefore they laugh.
Although exaggeration is easy, it must still be executed well. The
“seven feet wide by three feet tall” Christmas-tree dimensions were chosen
carefully after many other dime nsions were cast aside. For reasons that I
don’t entirely understand, seven  by three feet is funnier than nine by four
feet or five by two.
I tried them all. I didn’ t grab the first exaggeration that came to mind. I
acknowledged that the words are important and the choices shou ld be made
with care.
Humor can be an enormous and essential asset to storytelling. Most
people want to tell a funny story, and with some strategic crafting and
execution, most can. But remember that humor is not necessar y. There are
many great stories that are entirely humorless but are still highly effective
and beloved.
Humor is optional. Heart is nonnegotiable.
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Finding the Frayed Ending of Your
Story (or, What the Hell Did That
Mean?)
I was a member  of the Blackstone Millville Regional Junior Senior High
School marching band. I marched with the band from 1984 to 1989 as a
member of the drum corps, playing the bass drum and various percussion
instruments in the pit.
This was serious business. We were a competition marching band,
performing elaborate halftime shows, even though the school had neither a
football team nor a football field. We practiced in a school parking lot
painted with yard markers. We worked like hell. We were Massachusetts
champions for all the five years that I played in the band, and New England
champions in two of those years. I marched in the Macy’ s Thanksgiving
Day Parade, the Rose Parade, and down Main Street in both Disneyland and
Disney W orld. Serious business.
Every summer I spent a week at band camp preparing for the coming
season. Band directors would bring us to a college campus or a vacant
military base to plan and practice our music and marching routines for the
coming year .
For the first few years of band camp, until Massachusetts law changed,
this also meant hazing. Lots and lots of hazing. Hazing rituals included
being forced to carry the upperclassmen’ s drums, enduring shaving-cream
bombs, withstanding blasts of CO2 from fire extinguishers, and in some
cases, serious violence. It wasn’ t uncommon for my scalp to be split open
by the class ring of an uppercl assman, turned stone down to pummel my
skull. The 1980s  were a different time in America. John Hughes got it right.
These were not times of unity and acceptance in public high schools.
The worst of the hazing (other than the actual physical assaults) was
“doughboying.” In this case, an upperclassman (or a team of
upperclassmen) tossed a lowercl assman into a bathtub and covered him in a
combination of ingredients: flour, sugar , cornstarch, and yeast. Warm water
was then run over the victim until the mixture congealed into a sticky
substance that adhered to the skin. This was usually done just before a
three-hour pract ice in the hot August sun, thus allowing the mixture to bake
on the victim.
When you had been doughb oyed, everyone knew you had been
doughboyed. It was sticky , uncomfortable, but most of all embarrassing.
During lunch one day, I realized  that I had forgotten my sheet music in
my dorm room and went to retrieve it. Unbeknownst to me, three seniors
followed, including Eddie, the most violent person I had ever met. Eddie
had split my head open with his ring more than any other senior . He was the
person in my life that I feared most.
Eddie and his partners caught me running for the exit from the dorm and
dragged me down the hall, through their room, and into their bathroom.
I never had a chance. I was a fourteen-year -old noodle-shaped boy who
weighed no more than a hundred pounds. I’d yet to grow any facial hair or
any chest hair. Two in Eddie’ s posse had full mustaches, including Eddie.
One of the seniors worked a full-time job. They were men, and I was a boy .
Eddie and his gang tossed me into the bathtub and began the doughboy
process by pulling off my shirt and pouring the mix on my body . Once I
was in the batht ub, I stopped struggling. No sense fighting the inevitable.
Instead I used the only weapon I had available to me: my mouth.
I called them cowards. Punks. Future Losers of America. “Three against
one? What are you? A bunch of chickens? You’re twice my size, and it took
three of you to take me down? Y ou suck!”
Eddie’ s face darkened. I thought this was something that only happened
in Stephen King novels, but no, I was witnessing it in real life. He clenched
his fists. He was seething. I looked to the other two guys,  who were
standing just behind Eddie. Our eyes met. They knew what was about to
happen. They turned and walked out into the dorm hallway .
Eddie beat the hell out of me in that bathtub. He hurt me in a way I’d
never been hurt before. It took everything I had to stop myself from crying.
In my workshops, I allow students to choose a random story idea from
my list of untol d stories in my spreadsheet. As of this writing, there are
more than five hundred possible story ideas on that spreadsheet (moments
from the past and moments from my Homework for Life that have proven
storyworthy). This seems like a ridiculous number to many , but only
because they haven’ t been doing Homework for Life for the last six years
like me.
After the students choose a number , I demonstrate out loud how to craft
a story from that idea. It’s the most highly rated part of my workshops:
Students have the opportunity to watch me work on a brand-new story , just
as I do in real life. They listen and watch as I speak about the meaning of
my five-second moment, as I locate the right beginni ng, apply my
strategies, make  decisions, and often stop and start several times. It’s like
peeking into my brain as I’m thinking, processing, and adjusting. It’s a way
to watch my process unfold in real time.
It’s also my least favorite part of any workshop that I teach, because it
leaves me feeling naked, expose d, and ineffective. A process that normally
happens in the privacy of my shower , while walking my dog, or while
driving alone is on full display . Students listen to my unpolished, poorly
told, shitty first drafts, which they, as it turns out, like watching and hearing
a lot. It’s easy to listen to a well-crafted story from a professiona l storyteller
and assume that these things spring forth from our brains like tulips in the
spring. I wish. It’s a messy process. Ugly and halting and imperfect.
Knowing this makes my students feel better about their own messy process.
In a workshop three years ago, the class chose number 81 off my
spreadsheet, which corresponded to the story of my beating at band camp. It
read, “Eddie in a Bathtub.”
I groaned as my eyes settled on number 81. It was a bad choice. Even
worse than “First Introduction to Dry Sex,” which a class had chosen a year
earlier .
“Eddie in a Bathtub” was a five-second moment of my life, to be sure,
but I really had no idea why. We have moments like this in our lives, when
something happens to us and we know it’s important, but can’t explain
exactly why. It’s a memory that lingers in our consciousness, a moment that
remains locked in our heart; maybe it’s a time in our life that we frequently
revisit in dreams. This was one of those moments. “Eddie in a Bathtub” was
an important moment in my life, but I had no idea why .
In these cases, my advice to storytellers is always the same:
Tell your story . Speak it aloud. Don’ t worry about stakes or lies or
anything else. Don’ t fret over where to start or finish. Just tell the story as
honestly and completely as possible. Spill out all the details. Tell the overly
detailed version of your story . Through this process, you will often discover
(or rediscover) its meaning. You’ll come to understand the importance of
your five-second moment.
That’ s what happened to me on that day. I told the story — without any
thoughts of craft or polish — and when I reached the end, I knew . Through
the process of telling the story , I had managed to put myself back into that
bathtub, and instantly I understood why this moment had stuck with me for
two decades. I realized that the story had two important meanings for me:
1.It was the first time I realized that people will turn their backs in
the face of evil and walk away rather than taking a stand.
2.It was the first time I felt that the world was a fundamentally
unsafe place, that people will hurt you for no better reasons than
traditions and payback.
It wasn’ t an easy moment to confront in front of an audien ce of thirty
students. That bathtub was a terrible place for me, and when I found myself
in it again twent y years later, it was no better . I became emotion al. I rushed
to the end, leaving out the brutality and specificity of the beati ng. I wasn’ t
ready to share it all with an audience, but I had found the meaning. Two
meanings, really .
And that is no good.
Stories can never be about two things. I explained to my students that
even though that moment in the bathtub came to mean two different things
to me, the story that I tell onstage someday about that moment can only be
about one of those things.
This is because of what you already know:
The ending of the story — your five-second moment — will tell you
what the beginning of your story should be. The beginning will be the
opposite of the end.
If my story is about my realization that the world (and especially
people) are fundamentally unsafe and willing to hurt you for the pettiest of
reasons, the beginning of my story needs to present my previous belief that
people are basically good and the world is generally safe.
The arc of the story will trace  my path from innocence to cynicism.
From optimism to pessimism.
If my story is about how people will turn their backs on you in moments
of crisis, the beginning of my story needs to be about my belief that people
can be depended  upon in times  of need. The arc of the story will go from
faith in my fellow man to a loss of that faith.
This is why your story can never be about two things.
This does not mean that I can’t tell both versions of this story . In fact, as
a storyteller , I’m thrilled to have two stories that center on the same
moment. Those two stories, which have yet to be fully crafted, will start
entirely differen tly but will ultim ately conver ge on the same moment in the
bathtub.
If I’m telling about my newfound understanding of violence in this
world, I will include all the details of my experience in the bathtub. I will
allow my audience to experience the beating that I received at the hands of
Eddie that day. Since the story is centered on my newfound understanding
of this violent world, it should reflect that violence.
If I’m telling the story of my newfound understanding that people will
turn their backs in times of need, I might not include all the details of the
beating. I might move time forward and simply detail the injuries I suffered,
leaving the gory details to my audience’ s imagination.
The same mome nt, told two different ways depending upon what I want
to say .
This is not the only time I have discovered the meaning of a story
simply by telling it. It’s happen ed many times. Reimmersing myself in the
moment and telling as much of the story as possible, and ignoring all my
storytelling strategies in favor of telling everything that I remember , has
been exceptiona lly useful in finding the meaning behind those nagging
moments from my life. I’ve also watched many people discover the
meaning of their stories in my workshops through the same process. I’ve
watched people break down into tears upon realizing why a moment has
stuck with them for so long.
Just tell your story . All of it. Forget the strategies. Start in the wrong
place and end in the long place. Ramble. The goal is to return to that
moment as best as possible in order to find its meaning.
The other way of discovering the meaning of a moment is to ask yourself
why you do the things you do.
As I mentioned in a previous chapter , my father and I write letters to
each other . This is our prim ary form of communication . Since he
disappeared for most of my childhood and for much of my adult life, it has
been dif ficult for us to maintain an ongoing relationship.
We are miserable on the phone.
My father has never been on the internet.
He won’ t leave his hometown.
Eventually we settled on letters . It turns out that he’s an excellent writer .
He’s an even better storyteller . I just wish he would write faste r, but these
letters have allowed me to get to know my father better than ever before.
Just a couple of weeks ago, my wife asked what my father ’s most recent
letter contained. My answer: “I’ll let you read it.”
I said this because I had not read it myself. What I’ve never told my
wife (or anyone else) is that I don’t open any of my father ’s letters until I
receive another one from him. Sometimes this means I hang on to an
unopened letter for months. I always keep one unopened letter from my
father on hand at all times.
It was true that for the first letter , I was afraid of what he may or may
not have written, and that’s why I brought it to the movie theater to read.
But even today , I don’t open one of my father ’s letters until another one
arrives.
Why?
In the spirit of “Ask yourself why you do the things you do,” I did
exactly that: “Why do you do this? Why do you keep an unopened letter
from your father in your bag?”
I though t about my father . Our relationship. Our personal histor y. I told
myself the story of our history , starting with his disappearance from my life
following the divorce of my parents up until present day. I spoke the words
aloud, leaving nothing out. It took some time.
When I finished , I suddenly knew . The answer came to me as clear as
day. I keep an unopened letter from my father because ever since I was a
boy, I have waited for him to return to my life, and every time he has made
an appearance, I am afraid it will be his last. I have lived in fear that my
father will leave me again and never come back.
If I keep an unopened letter from my father , he can never leave me
again. I’m holdi ng on to this unexplored piece of him, and as long as I have
the promise of reading his letter someday , he can never disappear again.
Just like that, I have a story . It’ll be a good one too, I think. The kind of
story that will connect with many people on many levels.
Even better, I understand mysel f a little better now. I often ask myself
why I do the things I do. Sometimes the answer is simple:
You’re pedantic.
You’re neur otic.
You’re a jerk.
You’re selfish.
You like ice cr eam way too much.
You think “No Right on Red” signs ar e bullshit.
You despise the way neckties ar e nothing but decorative nooses.
But sometimes the answer to the question reveals something much deeper
— a hidden truth that often makes for a great story .
Bruce Springsteen once said in an interview: “Most people’ s stage
personas are created out of the flotsam and jetsam of their internal
geography and they’re trying to create something that solves a series of
very complex problems inside of them or in their history .”
I heard that and thought, “Yes.” It was the kind of yes that filled every
cell of my body .
Not yes. Yes.
Storytellers seek to constantly make meaning from their lives. We
contextualize events, find satisfying endings to periods of our lives, and
struggle to explain how our lives make sense and fit into a lar ger story .
Sometimes we see this meaning immediately . My wife says, “I know
that when you were a little boy , you didn’ t always have enough food to eat,”
and I know instantly what this means: Elysha knows me better than anyone
has ever known me. She might know me better than myself. And damn, she
must really love me.
But “Eddie in a Bathtub”? I needed to tell that one. I needed to get back
into that bathtub with Eddie to understand why this beating — more than
any of the other beatings I experienced that year at the hands of
upperclassmen — stayed with me for so long.
“Eddie in a Bath tub” was part of the flotsam and jetsam of my internal
geography . I needed to solve the complex problem of my history in order to
tell the story .
The unopened letter from my father , still sitting on my desk?
I needed to tell that one too. It wasn’ t until Elysha asked me what was in
my father ’s letter that it occurred to me that my ritual with his letters was
odd. Something that I was unwilling to tell her about. Something that I
didn’ t understand.
Those are the moments when I know that it’s time to tell myself a story
so I can understand my behavior and solve the complex problem of my
personal history . The solutions often make for great stories and provide us
with opportunities to more fully understand ourselves. To make meaning
out of who we are from the stories we have lived.
STORY BREAK
Reconnecting with My Mean Old Elementary
School Principal
In 2016, I told a story at a Moth GrandSLAM at the Music Hall of
Williamsbur g in Brooklyn about a time when I had to face down the
principal as a third grader . After stealing a classmate’ s stamp catalog, I was
forced to admit to the theft or risk allowing my entire class to be punished
for my crime.
Walking into the principal’ s office and telling him the truth that day
remains one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life. I can still
remember the moment as if it were yesterday , and I think about it often
when faced with the need to speak a difficult truth or admit to a mistake. It
was a lesson for a lifetime.
It wasn’ t a typical story for me. It was too long for a Moth slam, so I
stripped it down to its bones and retained more humor than heart. Not my
usual strategy , especially in competitive storytelling, but I enjoyed telling it
just the same. I don’t often go for the laugh as often as I did that night, and I
probably swore more on the stage that night than all the stage s I’ve ever
stood on combi ned. It was a different side of me as a storyteller . Not my
most ef fective side, but a fun alternative.
The principal’ s name was Fred Hartnett. I had not seen or spoken to him
since elementary school, althoug h a few years ago I discovered that the new
middle school in my hometown — built on the street where I grew up —
bears his name. I thought it was the perfect choice of name given  how much
that man still lives in my heart and mind almost four decades later .
Because Mr. Hartnett was my principal back in 1979 and seemed old
even then, I assumed that he had probably passed away years before, but
when I mentioned the story on Facebook, a former classmate sent me a
message informing me that Mr. Hartnett is alive and well and passed along
his email address.
Since then Mr. Hartnett and I have exchanged several emails . I can’t
believe it.
In additi on to the message I sent him, I attached a recording of the story
made at a Speak Up event, where I had first told the more complete version
of the story . He replied:
I certainly do remember you as well as other members of the Dicks
family . I must admit, however , I do not recall the incident you
referenced. Not surprising. It was a long career. That having been
said, I thor oughly enjoyed your pr esentation.
He went on to expound on the fates of several people in the story ,
including my teacher and a classmate who plays a significant  role in the
tale.
Regarding the new school bearing his name, he wrote:
As for the midd le school at BMRSD, it was my responsibility as
superintendent to construct it. The school committee announced the
dedication at graduation in 2003, the year I retired. I was, and
sometimes remain, uncomfortable about it, though relieved it’s not
posthumously! On occasion, when I drive in I reflect it’s similar to
seeing one’ s name on a tombstone.
The man still has it.
Remarkable how the power of The Moth has once again brought
someone back into my life and reestablished a connection that means so
much to me. Mr. Hartnett and I continue to exchange emails. A man who
once lived only in my heart and mind has come to life once again for me.
We have  discuss ed teaching, writing, and the course of our lives. It’s been
remarkable.
Tell your stories. On stages or in living rooms or at dinner table s. Share
them with friend s and family and people willing to listen. You never know
what might happen.

Telling Your Story
I hope I didn’ t bore you too much with my life story .

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
The Present Tense Is King (but the
Queen Can Play a Role Too)
I’m writing this chapter  on an Amtrak train from Washington, DC, to
Hartford, Connecticut. I’m not sitting in the quiet car, but it’s quiet
nonetheless. The train rocks back and forth on the rails, dramatically
increasing the frequency of typos. Elysha is sitting beside me. She’s
listening to music through earbuds and struggling with a crossword puzzle
on her phone.
It’s late afternoon. The sun hangs low in the sky. Sunlight is streaming
in throu gh the windows on the other side of the train car, brightening my
daughter ’s face. She’ s leaning against the window . Her legs are scooched up
underneath her blue and pink skirt. She’ s sitting quietly , reading. She’ s eight
years old, but today it seems as if she’s twice that. She looks so mature, so
together .
Her younger brother, Charlie, is sitting beside her in the aisle seat, just
an arm’s length away from me. He’s listening to music on an iPad through a
pair of blue headphones. He’ s fidgeting.
I turn back to the laptop on the tray in front of me. I should be thinking
about the best way to convey the idea of this chapter . I should be hunting
for the perfect story to illustrate  my point. I want to bang out this chapter
before we hit New Y ork City .
But I’m not thinking about this chapter at all. My mind is focused on
Charlie and his fidgeting. He needs to pee. He’s needed to pee since
Aberdeen, New Jersey , but he’s afraid of the restrooms on the train. In his
words, “They are yuck.”
The situation is becoming preca rious. I need this boy to pee, but it turns
out that you can’t make a human  being pee, even if you’re forty years older ,
150 pounds heavier , and his father. There are just some things that can’t be
done without consent. Peeing is one of these things.
Charlie’ s refusal to pee in the train’ s restroom worries me. We’re still
more than three hours from our home in Connecticut. The boy can’t hold it
for three hours, so there are only two possible conclusions to this
predicament: he has an accident, or I convince him to use the restroom.
It’s amaz ing how a five-year -old boy’s bladder is consuming so much of
my mental energy. I cannot stop thinking about his need to pee. It’s like a
blazing road sign in my mind.
He’s also occupying enormous amounts of my time. He’s signaling me
again to stop typing. He’s climb ing out of his seat. We’re off again, walking
to the end of our train car and then crossing over into the café car. This is
his fourth attempt to pee. He hopes that the restrooms in the café car are
somehow more palatable and less frightening.
They are not. This restroom is the same as the ones we’ve seen already ,
and we’ve seen a lot of them. “Porta-potty ,” Charlie declares as I slide open
the door . He shakes his head. “No, thank you.”
“It’s a toilet,” I say . “Everyone uses it.”
“Not me,” he says.
We turn around. As we wait for the conductor to clear the aisle so we
can pass, Charlie looks up at me and says, “I’m not proud of myself. If I
could pee in that potty , I would be proud, but I’m not.” Then his head drops.
He stares at his shoes.
My heart breaks . The train rocks, the conductor punches a ticke t, and a
little part of me dies. My son’s inability to pee in a less-than-id eal location
is affecting his sense of self. He feels bad about himself becau se he can’t
pee. This petty biological anno yance has blossomed into something more
serious.
We commence our walk of sham e through the café car and toward our
seats. A simple bodily function that I mastered long ago has now become
the bane of my existence. “This  too shall pass,” I whisper as we step back
into our car . I know it’ s true, but in this moment, I don’ t believe it.
Elysha looks at me hopefully . I shake my head in defeat.
Charlie sits. He’ s already wriggling again. This poor boy is suf fering. So
am I.
Do you feel as if you’re on the train with me? I’m trying like hell to put you
here, because I am still on the train, writing these words.
I want you to be here with me. I’m loading you up with sensory
information. The sounds and sights and feel of the train. I want  you to feel
that you’re occupying my space, experiencing time in the way I am
experiencing it now. I want you to feel the weight of my son’s reluctant
bladder .
Another strategy  that I’m using  to put you on this train with me is the
use of the present tense. These events are happening right now for me,
literally as I write this sentence, and, I hope, you feel as if they are
happening in the space and time that you are occupying as you read these
words.
This is the magi c of the present  tense. It creates a sense of immediacy .
Even though you are reading these words in bed or by the light of a roaring
fire or perhaps naked in your bathtub, a part of you, maybe, is on this train
with me, staring at a little boy who desperately needs to pee. The present
tense acts like a temporal magnet, sucking you into whatever time I want
you to occupy . It allows me to put you on an Amtrak train somewhere in
central New Jersey in the summer of 2017 or in my 1976 Chevy Malibu on
a lonely highway in New Hampshire in the fall of 1991 or in a chaotic
emer gency room on December 23, 1988.
The present tense will bring you a little closer to these moments in time.
It may even trick you into believing that you have time trave led back in
time to these moments.
Charlie wants to try to pee again. I thought he might ask Elysha this time,
but no. It’s me. It’s back to the restroom in the café car for us. “It’s the best
one,” he says.
I want to remind  him that he’s already dismissed it as a porta-p otty, but
I’m holding on to hope. He’s five and fairly illogical. Maybe this time will
be dif ferent.
Two years ago, Charlie, Clara, and I were playing at a school
playground on a hot summer day when Charlie announced that he had to
pee. The playground had no bathrooms, so I told Charlie that he would need
to pee on a tree or we’d have to go home. He had never peed while standing
up before, let alone on a tree, so he was skeptical. I coaxed him. Cajoled
him. Modeled the process for him. Cheered him on.
After a couple of minutes, Charlie peed on that tree. One of the proudest
moments of my life.
“I wish I could pee on a tree,” Clara said as I high-fived Charlie’ s
unwashed hand.
I was glad that Clara expressed  disappointment. I worry about Charlie.
His sister is three years older than he and is one of those kids who reads
exceptionally well, speaks in complete sentences at all times, and seems to
remember every thing she sees or hears. She possesses a vast storehouse of
information in her brain that she accesses with great ease and fluidity .
I worry that Charlie will compare himself unfavorably to his big sister
and think less of himself because of it. I’ve seen this happen to students,
especially when  the sister is older than the brother . The combination of the
age disparity and a boy’s propensity to mature much later in life often
leaves younger brothers feeling  dumb. I don’t want this for Charlie, so I
celebrate his accomplishments whenever I can. He peed on that tree, and
damn it, was I proud.
Clara couldn’ t. It was about time she couldn’ t do something that Charlie
could.
But now he can’t pee in an actual toilet, and I sense his confidence
waning. He sighs this little-boy  sigh. It’s tiny but terrible. “I will be proud
of myself, or I will be mad,” he says as we head back down the aisle again.
I open the door to the restroo m. He shakes his head. Sighs again.
Another failure.
A woman with two young boys smiles at me as we pass. She’s watching
us march down this aisle for the fifth time. She seems to get it.
I don’ t.
Did you see what I did there? I opened that section in the present tense
again, trying like hell to suck you back into the time and space of the train,
but then I shifted to the past tense when I slipped into backstor y about the
day I taught Charlie how to pee on the tree. I did this deliberately , for two
reasons:
1.I didn’ t want to compromise the immediacy of the train part by
bringing in a second present tense to my story . If I spoke about
Charlie’ s tree-peeing lesson in the present tense as well, then I
would risk diluti ng the visceral, present-tense nature of the train.
Stories cannot have two or more events that took place at
different times happen in the present time of the story . It’s like
putting a hat on a hat.
2.The use of the past tense in backstory makes sense. It’s in the
past. It should be presented as such. This is not always the case,
but it’s often the case. When in doubt, tell backstory using the
past tense.
Following the tree-peeing backs tory, I end that last section by returning
you to the present tense. I placed you back on the train, walkin g down the
aisle, passing the woman with the knowing glance after another failed
attempt. I want you with me on that train again, if you left at all.
There are other reasons to shift tenses when telling a story . Sometimes I
want to push an audience back before bringing them forward again. I do
this in “This Is Going to Suck” when I reveal that my friends are filling the
waiting room outside the emer gency room. Look how often I shift tenses in
this paragraph:
But I’m not alone, because when the nurse called McDonald’ s to tell
them about the accident, the manager on duty told my friends, and
those friends started calling other friends. An old-fashioned phone
tree begins, with friends calling friends calling friends, and the
waiting room is now filling up with sixteen- and seventeen- and
eighteen-year -old kids in ripped jeans and concert T-shirts, and one
fourteen-year -old boy who is cooler than all of them. And my friend
Bengi is the first one to arrive.
I start in the present tense (“But I’m not alone”), but then shift to the past
tense to something you already  know happened (“when the nurse called
McDonald’ s”). Then I shift back to the present tense (“An old-fashioned
phone tree begins, with frien ds calling friends calling friends”), even
though I’m still relating information from the past. This phone tree already
happened. The waiting room is already full of kids. I’m about to tell you
this, but I still want this past event told in the present tense.
I do this becau se the disclosure that “an old-fashioned phone tree
begins” is a powerful moment in the story . It means a lot to me, and I hope
it will mean a lot to my audience. I want them to feel as if it’s happening in
the present. I want them to see teenagers calling teenagers, rushing to my
assistance while my parents go to check on the car first.
I can’t tell you about this phone tree when it’s actually happening,
because it would ruin the surpr ise of my friends in the waiting room, so I
tell you about it after it has happened — but in the present tense.
While these time shifts were admittedly intentional, many are not. As
you begin to tell stories in the present tense, the shift from present to past to
present will become instinctual as you learn to sense when you want your
audience in the present momen t as opposed to the past. I hit a moment of
heightened emotion or increased gravity , so I instinctually shift to the
present tense if I’m not alread y there, because this is when I want my
audience “in the now.” Similarly , when I launch into backsto ry, I almost
always instinctually shift into the past tense. It just makes sense.
When she was editing The Moth ’s collection of stories, Catherine Burns
told me that she discovered that storytellers shift tenses constantly , but it’s
not something you would notice  unless you’re trying to put these stories on
the page. These constant tense shifts are nearly undetect able in their oral
versions. But on the page, they become obvious and challenging. They can
stick out like a sore thumb.
“I really need to pee,” Charlie says. He’ s standing in the aisle again, tugging
on my sleeve.
“I know you need to pee,” I say . “But will you actually pee this time?”
“Yes,” he says, grabbing hold of my arm for balance as the train rocks
back and forth. I look out my window . The skyline of Manhattan is on the
edge of the horizon, on the other side of the river .
“Fine,” I say, a little too annoyed for my liking. He’s five years old and
frightened. Now I feel like a jerk.
I hand my laptop to Elysha, stuf f my phone into my pocket, and stand.
“Good luck,” she says.
I’m not sure if she’ s speaking to me or Charlie.
“Let’ s go to the café car ,” Charlie says. “I think it’ s the best one.”
“Okay , buddy ,” I say. I reach down and take his hand. I squee ze it. “I
love you.”
“C’mon, Dad!” he says.
There’ s one more benefit to the present tense: It helps you see your story .
Some storyteller s are able to see their stories. As they tell it, they almost
relive the moments. Rather than staring into the eyes of their audience, their
minds recreate a vision of the events as they unfold.
I see my stories. When the Mercedes is barreling down on me and the
double doors are opening on the emer gency room and my friends are
standing there, I see them in my mind’ s eye. I can see the events again as if
a movie is playing in my eyes.
Seeing your story as you tell it is a great thing. It will help you connect
to it more effectively . Your emotional state will more closely match your
actual emotions from the time and place that you are describing. When you
can see your story, it is more likely that your audience will see your story
too.
Charlie peed. On our sixth attempt, as we entered Penn Station, he agreed to
sit on the toilet after I assured him for the 1 19th time that it was just a toilet.
“I did it, Dad,” he said as he hopped of f the toilet.
“I’m so proud of you, Charlie.”
“No,” he said. “ I’m so proud of me.”
Even better . My eyes fill with tears in the restroom of a train heading
north to Connecticut. Crisis averted. Pride intact. A moment I will never
forget.
Did you notice that I told much of that last bit in the past tense? Do you
know why?
If you were thinking that I used the past tense because I didn’ t write this
last section on the train, you would be correct. I’m sitting in the dining area
at Kripa lu Center for Yoga and Health in the Massachusetts Berkshires,
three days removed from our train ride.
But this is not why. I chose the past tense because I was writing about
Charlie peeing on the train. I didn’t feel I needed to bring you into that tiny
restroom with me while my son was sitting bare-assed on the toilet.
Some things are told better from a distance. Urination, I think, is one of
them.
But then I switc hed to the presen t tense when I admitted to crying in the
restroom, because in that moment, I wanted you as close to me as possible.
But the importan t part is this: I made the choice. I weighed my options.
I didn’ t simply default to one tense. I chose what I thought was the correct
tense for that particular moment.
That said, not every person can tell stories in the present tense. I meet
many people who have been telling stories exclusively in the past tense for
years. Shifting to the present tense occupies so much of their mental
bandwidth that it does more harm than good.
There is nothing  wrong with telling a story from the past — even five
minutes in the past — using the past tense. You will not be a terrible
storyteller if you do. In a lot of ways, this is the most intuitive, logical, and
expected way to talk about the past. It makes a lot of sense.
But try the present tense. See if it’s something you can fall into
naturally . If you can, great. You’ll have a much better chance of drawing
your audience into your story and perhaps seeing your story as well. You’ll
have more choices to make in crafting your story , and they will give you an
additional strategy for your toolbox.
If you can’t do it, I’ve loaded that toolbox up already with plenty of
strategies, more than you can probably manage at this point. Better to tell
your story well from the past tense than poorly (or unnaturally , or
stressfully) from the present tense.
If You Practice Storytelling or Public Speaking in a Mirror ,
Read This. If Y ou Don’ t, Skip It.
In all the time I have been coaching storytellers, one thing comes up again and again that
makes no sense to me: people tell me that they rehearse their stories and speeches in front of a
mirror .
I am always baf fled by this strategy . Why a mirror? When you’re performing onstage or
speaking in a conference room or interviewing in an of fice or presenting in a classroom,
you’re never looking at yourself. Y ou’re looking at other people. In fact, the only person in
the room you can’ t see and will never see is you.
The only place in the world where you shouldn’ t rehearse is in front of a mirror . It’s the
only time that you are guaranteed to be seeing something that you will never see while
speaking.
Not only will practicing in front of a mirror not help, but I suspect that it might hurt your
performance. The very last thing you should be worried about while speaking is what you
look like. It’ s your words, your inflection, your tonality , your ease of speech, and your choice
of vocabulary that matter . The tilt of your head, the twinkle in your eyes, and the angle of
your smile are all irrelevant. If you’re thinking about your appearance while speaking, you’re
not dedicating all your concentration to the one thing that matters.
Storytellers often ask me what to do with their hands when performing. My answer:
Nothing. Let them be. Allow them to do what they will do. If you’re thinking about your
hands, you’re thinking about the wrong thing.
Mirror practice only encourages attention on your physical appearance. Don’ t do it.
Practice in front of anything but a mirror . You have a greater chance of seeing a Canada goose
or a shambling corpse than you have of seeing yourself while you’re speaking.
Instead of a mirror , practice in front of other people. Or in front of pictures of other
people. Or a wall. Anything, really . Anything but you.
Why would you practice doing something in a way that will never happen in real life?
STORY BREAK
A Storyteller and a Magician
Elysha and I are dancing at The Moth Ball in 2015 when a Moth staffer
approaches and asks for me to follow her. A donor would like to meet me.
Elysha ditches me for the restroom, and I follow the staffer into the dining
room, where I am introduced to a man named David.
“I’d like you to tell your story again,” he says. “So I can record it into
my phone.”
I agree, even though the request is odd. While we wait for the Moth
staffer to secure us a quiet spot, I ask the man if he’s ever told a story
before.
“I did a TED Talk once about how I held my breath for seventeen
minutes.”
I stare at him. “Are you David Blaine?” I asked. “The world-famous
magician?”
“Yes,” he says. “I thought they told you.”
I tell my story again. David Blaine records my performance. Then he
offers to perform a card trick for me. I agree.
David Blaine then proceeds to convince me that magic is real. At the
end of his trick, I find a playing  card that I had signed in my shoe, which I
never removed throughout the duration of the trick. It’s so unbelievable that
I am a little frightened. I turn to a New Y orker  reporter  who tagged along to
watch the trick.
“Did you see that?” I ask.
“How did he do it?” she asks.
“I don’t know ,” I say. “It’s impossible. I think he made a deal with the
devil.”
David Blaine laughs. “I’d like to talk to you more about storytelling, if
you don’ t mind. Let me give you my card.”
“Okay ,” I say .
“You already have it,” he says. “Left breast pocket.”
Sure enough, it’s there. It’s a playing card — the king of spades  — with
his contact information embedded within.
We say good-bye, and I go and find Elysha. I tell her what she just
missed. She’ s still angry to this day .
CHAPTER NINETEEN
The Two Ways of Telling a Hero
Story (or, How to Avoid Sounding
Like a Douchebag)
No one likes a braggart.
If you’re religious, perhaps you know Proverbs 27:2: “Let another man
praise thee, and not thine own mouth.”
Or Leonardo da V inci: “He who truly knows has no occasion to shout.”
Or Mark Twain: “Noise proves  nothing. Often a hen who has merely
laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid.”
One of my favorites is by humorist Evan Esar: “The only way to cure an
egotist from bragging is by sur gery — amputation at the neck.”
Avoiding bragging can make storytelling difficult, because we all have
moments of true accomplishment that we want to share, and, in some cases,
we are almost required to share:
Job interviews
College applications
Meeting the in-laws for the first time
There is nothing wrong with sharing your success stories, but they are
hard stories to tell well. The truth is this: failure is more engaging than
success.
You’d rather hear from the ballplayer who struck out in the ninth inning
with the bases loaded to lose the World Series than the slugger who hit the
home run to win the W orld Series. It’ s just a better story .
Getting fired from your dream job is probably more entertaining than
being hired for your dream job.
Tragic first-date stories are far better than perfect first-date stories.
The story of an F is almost always better than the story of an A+.
Think about it this way: The story of an incredible meal at an amazing
restaurant is unlikely to contain  anything of merit in terms of story . More
than likely it will simply be an oral accounting of the food that a person
consumed attached to a series of adjectives describing each item.
But if I told you that I was served soup with a fly flittering amongst the
beef and vegetables, trying not to drown, you would likely ask, “What did
you do?”
Why?
Something is going to happen. W e have ourselves a potential story .
Nevertheless, there are times when you might want to tell a success
story , and when you do, there are two strategies that I suggest you employ .
1.Malign yourself.
2.Marginalize your accomplishment.
Rather than attempting to be grandiose about yourself or your success,
you must undermine both you and it. This is because of two realities:
First, human beings love underd og stories. The love for the underdog is
universal. Underdogs are supposed to lose, so when they manage to pull out
an unexpected or unbelievable victory , our sense of joy is more intense than
if that same underdog suffers a crushing defeat. A crushin g defeat is
expected. An unbelievable win is a surprise.
You already know the importanc e of surprise in storytelling. If you cast
yourself as the underdog, your audience will enjoy your success. They will
root for you. They will expect you to lose and hope for you to win.
This is why Bruce W illis is outnumbered and barefoot in Die Har d.
This is why Star Wars opens on a massive star destroyer attacking
Princess Leia’ s tiny rebel ship.
This is why Jack is from the wrong side of the tracks in Titanic .
Underdogs are what make movi es like Rudy , Revenge of the Nerds, The
Breakfast Club , Miracle , The Karate Kid, A League of Their Own , Rocky ,
The Bad News Bears , Erin Brockovich , and Hoosiers  so beloved. All of
these movies feature protagonists who are not expected to win. They are
flawed, for gotten, failed people who achieve unexpected success.
In a story entitled “Bring Me a Shrubbery ,” I tell about changing the life
of a chronically shy student named Lisa through our unexpected shared love
of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Through the humor of Monty Python,
Lisa begins using her voice for the first time. Lisa’ s parents tell me that I
“saved her life” by bringing their withdrawn daughter out of her shell and
helping her to make friends.
It’s a success story, to be sure, but I open the story by describing a
moment on the first day of school that year when I throw my shoe in the
direction of a student and accidentally clock her in the head.
Why do I open my story with this moment? I want to be sure that my
audience knows  that I’m not perfect, nor am I pretending to be. I’m not the
best teacher in the world. Not even close.
I may save a girl’s life, but I also struck a child with flying footwear . I
marginalize myself. I cast myself as the underdog by sharin g a highly
imperfect mome nt of teaching, so I can tell you about the close r-to-perfect
one later .
Second, human beings prefer stories of small steps over large leaps.
Most accomplishments, both great and small, are not composed of singular
moments but are the culminatio n of many small steps. Overni ght success
stories are rare. They can also be disheartening to those who dream of
similar success. The step-by-ste p nature of accomplishment is what people
understand best.
This is how to tell a success story: Rather than telling a story  of your
full and complete accomplishment, tell the story of a small part of the
success. Tell about a small step. Feel free to allude to the better days that
may lie ahead, but don’ t try to tell everything. Small steps only .
In “Brin g Me a Shrubbery ,” Lisa’ s parents tell me that I saved their
daughter ’s life. It’s a joyous moment for me, and I feel incredible for
exactly three days. Then I pass by Stephanie in the hallway , a former
student and an equally shy girl. Stephanie was so shy that her friend Quiana
often spoke on her behalf when she was in my class.
I didn’t save Stephanie. I quit on her. I never found her Monty Python
and the Holy Grail.  What was even worse, I stopped trying to find it.
There were others too. Kelly from a couple years before. Kayla  from a
year before that. And in my first year of teaching, Joseph, whose voice I
cannot remember , probably because he barely spoke in class that year. I
didn’ t save any of them.
In fact, I didn’ t even save Lisa. I got lucky . I shouted out the line from a
movie, and by some miracle, it connected with a student in an unexpected
way. I gave Lisa the space and encouragement to grow and thrive, but had I
not shouted that line from Monty Python and the Holy Grail , she could have
ended up like Stephanie and all the rest.
In the end, it’s a success born from good fortune, but it was just one
student. So many others had already passed through my classroom quietly .
That is what my story is about.
I maligned myself by admitting I’d thrown a shoe at a student.
I marginalized my accomplishment by pointing out that while I may
have saved Lisa, I had failed to save the many who came before her .
I know. It’s not the easiest thing to do. Sometimes we are so proud of
our hard-fought  success stories that we want to tell every bit of them.
Sometimes we want to be the hero, damn it. But the line betwe en hero and
insuf ferable person is a thin one. Caution is advised.
Sometimes you can’t help but tell the whole story . In the summer of
2017 I worked with a man named Tim Warren who summited Mount
Everest years before. Is Tim expected to stop his story halfway to the top of
the tallest mountain in the world?
No. That would be ridiculous. But Tim also failed to reach the summit
on his first attempt, and he certainly didn’ t reach the top on his own. He
was part of a climbing team. By passing on some of the credit to the
teammates who made his climb possible, and by highlighting his initial
failure, Tim can tell the story of his ascent in a way that an audience can
relate and connect to.
I also suggested this: Can Tim’s story be about something other than
Mount Everest?  Can the climb to the summit be about something more
personal? More  interior? Perhaps a bit of individual growth that resulted
from the climb?
I know it sounds crazy to turn the summiting of Mount Ever est into
something other  than the summiting of Mount Everest, but if I can turn a
story about putting my head through a windshield and dying on the side of
the road into a story about my friends taking the place of my family , why
not?
If the successful climb taught Tim to trust others, listen to his gut,
accept failure, find inner peace, believe in himself, or uncover a strength he
never knew he possessed, that would make for a story with much greater
universal appeal and potential connectivity .
We all have our own Mount Everests to summit. Tim’s just happened to
be the real thing. If he can use that enormous pile of rock and ice to reach
his audience on their own level by expressing something more personal
about his feat, the power of the story and its potential to connect to an
audience increases exponentially .
Summiting Mount Everest is an adventure story . Changing your life by
summiting Mount Everest is a great story .
STORY BREAK
“Fine” Is Apparently Not a Good Way to Describe
My Sex Life
I’m backstage at a TEDx conference at Kripalu Institute for Yoga and
Health in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In a few minutes, I’ll be standing in
that red circle, telling a story and talking about Homework for Life.
As I review my story in my head, Dr. Ruth Westheimer appears. She’s
following me onstage.
“Hello, Dr. Ruth,” I say. I introduce myself. I tell her how honored I am
to share a stage with her. I tell her that my wife would love to meet her if
there’ s time at the end of the conference.
“Tell me about your sex life,” she says.
I shouldn’ t be surprised by this request, but I am. I stutter for a moment
before saying, “It’ s fine.”
She shakes her head. “Fine is not good.” Then she of fers me five tips for
improving my sex life with my wife. I diligently write them down.
After I’m done speaking, I meet my wife in the lobby . “Dr. Ruth gave
me some tips for our sex life,” I say , perhaps a little too excitedly .
“Why did you ask Dr. Ruth for advice on our sex life?” Elysha asks.
She sounds annoyed. She’ s clearly not as excited about this as I am.
CHAPTER TWENTY
Storytelling Is Time Travel (If You
Don’t Muck It Up)
I am not a spiritual person.  Nor am I one drawn to mysticism,
transcendental planes, or otherworldly notions.
I am much more of a blunt stick. Straightforward. Uncomp licated.
Grounded in what I can touch and see. I eat an Egg McMuf fin for breakfast
every day. I don’t practice yoga because no one is keeping score. I don’t
pray or meditate . I don’t believe in ghosts or angels. I have no superstitions.
I don’t even throw coins into fountains to make wishes. I’m a joy to be
around.
So this is the only time I’m going to get a little hokey with you. The
only time I’ll propose somethin g less than tangible. Here is what I believe:
In its best form, storytelling is time travel. If I am doing my job well and
telling an excellent story , you may, for just a moment, forget that you exist
in the present time and space and travel back to the year and location that I
am describing.
My goal as a storyteller is to make my audience forget that the present
moment exists. I want them to forget that I exist. I want their mind’ s eye to
be filled with images of the movie I am creating in their brains. I want this
movie to transport them back to the year and spot that my story takes place.
A lonely New Hampshir e highway in the fall of 1991
The sidewalk outside of a r ecord stor e on December 23, 1988
Main Str eet in Newington, Connecticut, in a rainstorm at 2:00 AM
If a story teller is performing well, and if the conditions are right , I think
this magic can happen. I believe that audiences — in theaters, in
boardrooms, or at dinner tables — can be transported back into the past.
It’s admittedly easier to achieve this form of time travel if the conditions
are just right. Lights turned down. Comfortable chair . Silence. Perhaps even
a glass of wine or beer in the bellies of your audience members.
This is why movie theaters are designed the way they are. Film makers
want you to forget that you’re watching fiction. They want you to laugh and
cry and worry about people who are pretending to be other people in a story
that never actually happened.
It sounds crazy , but you know it works. You’ve become so engrossed in
the lives of fake people that you have wept among strangers in the dark.
This is what great storytelling can do.
Filmmakers also want you to forget about your own life for a while. Put
aside your troub les. Ignore the fact that you’re sitting beside strangers in a
seat that has been occupied by thousands of strangers before you.
Filmmakers want to transport you too. Not through time, but to a fictional
world they have created on the screen.
As a storyteller , I seek a similar  goal. I attempt to encircle my audience
in a time-traveling bubble. I want to thrust them back to a time and place of
my determinatio n. If I’m doing  it right, and my audience is in the right
frame of mind, and the conditions are ideal, I believe it can happen.
But it’s a fragile  bubble. It can be popped easily . It doesn’ t take much.
Storytellers must be careful if they don’t want to ruin any time-traveling
magic that they might muster .
Here are some rules to avoid popping this mystical bubble:
Don’ t ask rhetorical questions.
Actors in movies never ask rhetorical questions of their audience (Ferris
Bueller ’s Day Off  being the only exception I have found so far), and neither
should you. Asking a rhetorical question causes the audience to devise an
answer in their mind. You have  just turned your story into a Q&A session.
You’ve reminde d them that you exist, they exist, and this moment that you
and they are occupying exists.
Don’ t address the audience or acknowledge their existence
whatsoever .
Avoid phrases like “You guys!” for the same reason you shouldn’ t ask
rhetorical quest ions. When a storyteller says something like “You guys,
you’re not going to believe this!” the bubble is instantly broken. T ime travel
has abruptly ended. The audience is keenly aware that someone  is standing
in front of them, speaking directly to them and the people sitting around
them.
This also applies when the audie nce talks back to you. If you say, “I was
walking across the campus at Ohio State” and someone in the audience
shouts in approval at the mention of their alma mater , say nothing and do
nothing. Unless you’re speaking in a Baptist church, storytelling is rarely a
call-and-response scenario, so pretend the whoop or the cheer was never
uttered. Ignore it completely .
We disre gard fools in the hope  that our lack of recognition will cause
them to cease acting foolish in the future. Allow them to silently stew in a
puddle of shame and regret, and move on.
No props. Ever .
I once listened to a man tell a story about his frantic sprint through the
Miami airport while dragging his daughter to catch a flight. He treated
everyone in his path terribly . He was rude, dismissive, and unkind. When he
finally arrived at the ticket coun ter, he demanded that the airline employee
hurry so he and his daughter could board the plane before it was too late.
The airline employee looked at the ticket, smiled, and told the man not to
worry . He had plenty of time. The ticket was for next month.
The man looked down at his daughter and realized that he had just
dragged her through the airport, setting the worst example for her ever. He
felt like a fool.
Great story told brilliantly . I could feel the heat and humidity of Miami.
I could see the throngs of travelers blocking his path. I could even hear the
public-address system call out flight numbers and gates. I was in that airport
with him and his child. Brilliant.
Then he removed the ticket from his back pocket and waved it to the
audience. “And it’s still good,” he said. “Too bad I won’ t be in Miami three
days from now to use it.”
Pop! That was it. I was no longer in the Miami airport. I was in a theater
in Brooklyn, staring at a middle-aged man with a piece of paper in his hand.
Time travel over .
Did the ticket help his story? Of course not. It punched his nearly
perfect story right in the mouth.
Don’ t use props. They never help. Even worse, they always hurt.
Avoid anachronisms.
An anachronism is a thing that is set in a period other than that in which it
exists. It’s a microwave in the Middle Ages. A refrigerator during the
Renaissance. The internet during the Inquisition.
If you’re telling a story about something that happened in 1960, but at
some point you say that your mission was as unlikely as the moon landing,
you’ve created a temporal impo ssibility in the story and likely popped your
time-traveling bubble.
Anachronisms are like sledgehammers, reminding us that this story is
just a story . It reinforces the idea that we are not traveling through time.
Sometimes, unfortunately , they are also unavoidable.
In “Charity Thief,” I mention that it’ s 1991 and cell phones don’ t exist. I
hate saying this. If cell phones didn’ t exist in 1991, then they shouldn’ t be
spoken of at all in my story .
The only reason I mention the absence of a cell phone is because too
many millennial s have asked me why I didn’ t have a cell phone on that day,
so I feel the need to control their wonder by reminding the audience that
something that didn’ t exist in 1991 did not exist in 1991.
Apparently if you’ve lived in a world where cell phones have always
existed, it’s hard to imagine them not existing. Annoying. But in most
cases, I avoid these anachronisms at all costs.
Don’ t mention the word story  in your story .
Phrases like, “But that’s a story for another day,” or “Long story short”
serve to remind our audience that we are telling a story . If your audience
knows that you’re telling a story , then they’re not time traveling.
Downplay your physical presence as much as possible.
When I tell a story onstage (or even in a workshop or at a conference), I
wear blue jeans, a black T-shirt, and a hat. I wear this every time. It’s my
uniform, chosen because it suits me as a person and is fairly nondescript.
My goal is to downplay my physical presence. I want to increase the
likelihood of becoming a disem bodied voice in the mind of my audience. I
want them to completely for get that I’m standing in front of them.
There was a time when I varied my outfit slightly . I wore graphical T-
shirts and other variations of shirts and pants. Then I took the stage in
Boston one night wearing a T-shirt featuring a half-dozen storm troopers
from Star Wars, sitting on a beam, looking like construction workers. As I
adjusted the microphone, a cluster of audience members up front began to
laugh.
I looked. Why were they laughing? I listened. They were laughing at the
graphic on my shirt.
I didn’t want my audience laughing yet. I didn’ t want them looking at
me. I didn’ t want them taking inventory of my wardrobe or thinking about
my shirt at all. From that moment on, I’ve opted for the same bland outfit
every time.
This is not to say that jeans and a black T-shirt are my recommendation
for everyone. Just don’t wear clothing that might upstage you or attract the
audience’ s attention during your story .
An audience member once told me, “Listening to you tell a story is like
listening to an audiobook.” Exactly what I wanted.
STORY BREAK
I Berate Storytellers at the Worst Moments
I’m sitting in the wings with storytellers at one of our biggest Speak Up
shows of the year. We’ve sold out a 550-seat theater in downtow n Hartford,
and Elysha is center stage, introducing our first storyteller of the night, Jeni
Bonaldo. I’m sitting beside Jeni, demanding that she start her first novel.
“Write a sentence a day,” I say. “And then make it a page a day. Write a
page a day , and after a year , you’ll have a novel.”
“You’re always berating me for not accomplishing enough,” she says.
“It’s never enough for you.”
I’ve just launche d into a lecture  on the importance of goal setting when
I hear Elysha reaching the end of Jeni’ s introduction, and I realize that this
woman is about to take the biggest stage of her life, and I have just spent
the last minute before her performance haranguing her .
As she rises from her chair , I try to tell her how impressed I am with
everything that she does. Teacher . Storyteller . Mother . Future novelist. I
don’t think she hears a word I say as she steps into the light.
She performs brilliantly . Truly. She is vulnerable and hilari ous and
heartbreaking. She is beautiful. But it isn’ t any thanks to me.
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
Words to Say, Words to Avoid
In 2007,  a small band of terrible human beings excerpted about ten years’
worth of my blog entries and created a thirty-seven-page packet  designed to
make me look like a violent, sexually deviant person who was unfit to teach
children in a classroom. The authors also accused me of receivin g excessive
favoritism from  my principal and demanded that he and I be fired
immediately , along with my wife, who was teaching in the same school at
the time. The packet was signed by “The Concerned Parent Body of West
Hartford.”
The authors took my words out of context to fabricate a persona that
was unlike anything that existed in reality . For example, in one blog post, I
wrote about my opposition to placing text on the butts of female clothing.
At the time, the Juicy brand was all the rage, so elementary-school-aged
girls were walking down the hallways of my school with “Juicy” plastered
across their bottoms. I questione d a company’ s decision to manu facture this
product and the parent’ s decision to purchase this clothing and wrote, “Even
worse, the eye is naturally and unavoidably drawn to text, so I find myself
staring at girls’ butts every day .”
The only line excerpted for the packet was, “I find myself staring at
girls’ butts every day,” withou t any reference to the Juicy brand or my
moral outrage against it.
Under the category of favoritis m was listed this out-of-context quote:
“[My principal] said I can take as much time off as I want. ‘Do whatever
you want to do,’ he said.”
The authors failed to include the fact that this was said to me on the day
that my mother died.
The authors included photos that I had taken while in Bermuda of the
photos of barely clothed models hanging in the storefronts. I wrote the post
to criticize the objectification of women for the purposes of selling these
products to women, but again, the only thing included in the packet were
the photos and the suggestion that I am obsessed with sex.
This kind of deliberate manipulation went on for thirty-seven pages. I
wrote about my love of the classic Calvin and Hobbes  snowmen, often
drawn in morbid and horrific poses, so the authors of the packet implied
that this was something I did with regularity . I was compared to the Virginia
Tech killer and referred to as “sick,” “deviant,” and “violent.” Page after
page of unfair , deceitful characterization.
The authors threatened to send this packet to every family in my school
district, as well as the press, if action was not taken immediately . It was sent
to the superintendent, the mayor , and every member of the board of
education and the town council.
The district placed me on three days of administrative leave in order to
conduct an investigation. After three days, the human-resources director
found that I was well within my First Amendment rights while writing my
blog and had not written anything that would preclude me from teaching
children. I had done nothing wrong.
It was a hit job, plain and simple, most likely perpetrated  (in the
estimation of the human-resou rces director) by a colleague or former
colleague with an ax to grind. He assured me that threats to send material of
this nature to the press or public  were never acted upon, and I had nothing
to worry about. I returned to school triumphant and finished my year .
Two weeks into my summer vacation, the packet was mailed to more
than three hundr ed families in my school district. In addition, it was handed
out in driveway s. Stuffed under windshield wipers. Copied and distributed
widely . Having taken down my blog (at the request of the district), there
was no longer any context that readers could apply to the pack ets. Each of
the examples now stood on its own.
A firestorm erupted in my town. It was a long and terrible summer filled
with meetings with the superintendent, union representatives, attorneys, and
town officials. My realized dream of teaching children was now in
jeopardy , and my wife’ s career was teetering as well.
Ultimately , the parents of the twenty-three children who were placed in
my classroom in the coming school year were given a choice: keep your
child in my class or move your child to another class without prejudice.
Because of the inflammatory nature of the packet and the lack of
context, the district expected every parent to pull their child from my
classroom. If so, it was decided that I would be assigned an administrative
position at T own Hall and likely never teach children in my district (perhaps
in any school district) ever again.
Of the twenty-th ree children assigned to my class that year, all twenty-
three families opted to keep their children in my classroom. In addition,
another twenty families contact ed the superintendent, asking to place their
child in my class if a spot opened. The superintendent called me and
demanded that I stop soliciting support from these parents. I told him (in all
honesty) that I had not spoken to a single parent all summer . These were
unprompted, unsolicited requests.
“Stuf f it,” I told him.
It was a happy ending to a horrible series of events. To this day, I don’t
know for certai n who the anon ymous authors of the packet were. I have
evidence of some, but perhaps not all. It’s possible that one of the authors
still works in my school district . Not a day goes by that I don’t think about
what happened to me and how powerful anonymity can be.
I owe those twen ty-three families so much. They knew me. They trusted
me. They were willing to look beyond the accusations and supposed
evidence and think thoughtfully about me as a person.
But what also saved me was the reputation I had established over my
first eight years of teaching and how careful I had been with the words on
my blog and in person. While I was admittedly offering controversial
opinions and frequently played devil’ s advocate on my blog, district
officials expressed great appreciation for the fact that I had never mentioned
my school district or colleagues  by name, never used profanity or vulgarity
on my blog, and never promoted my blog to students or colleagues.
My decision to keep my blog clean and free of specific teaching
references and vulgarity helped a lot.
I continu e to blog daily , but I still don’t swear or speak profanel y on my
blog. I don’t criticize my school district or my colleagues. You’ll never find
a photograph of my holding a beer or drinking wine. I knew what to write
and what not to write to preserv e my reputation in my community . I knew
where the line was, and I often stepped on it but never over it.
It saved me.
As a storyteller , you need to do the same. Whether you are telling a
story to a coworker , conducting a presentation in a boardroom, toasting
your brother at a wedding, or performing onstage, the words you choose
will in part determine how your audience perceives you. It will impact the
opinions that they form about you.
Here is my advice in these matters.
Profanity
I don’t swear much when I’m telling a story . In truth, I don’t swear often in
real life. And I don’ t swear often in storytelling, for a couple of reasons.
To date, The Moth has been generous enough to air eight of my stories
on their podcast and The Moth Radio  Hour , providi ng me with an audience
numbering in the millions. To make it easier for The Moth and others to use
my stories publicly , I try to tell stories suitable for the masses.
Avoiding swearing also makes it easier for public and private
organizations, religious institutions, school systems, and the like to trust me
and hire me. A storyteller who leans heavily on profanity isn’t likely to be
hired to teach children, rabbis, corporate executives, librarians, priests, or
teachers. He’s less likely to be hired to perform for nonprofits, yoga
institutes, holiday parties, religious retreats, high schools, and more.
Also, swearing is lazy. In most cases, a swear word can be replaced by a
better word or phrase. The swear word is easy and may engender a laugh,
but it’ s rarely the best word to choose.
That said, there are times when I think it is appropriate to swear:
•Repeated dialog ue: The kid who arrives at my car acciden t
swears. He says, “Dude, you’re fucked.” It’s his words, repeated
exactly .
•When a swear is simply the best word possible: There is no
better way to describe my former stepfather than asshole , so that
is the word I choose every time.
•Moments of extreme emotion: There are certainly times in our
lives when the best way to capture the heightened emotion of a
moment — particularly when it comes to anger and fear — is
with profanity .
•Humor: Though I would never rely solely on profanity for
humor , there are moments when a well-placed swear word
makes a perfect punch line to a joke.
Vulgarity
Vulgarity is the description of events that are profane in nature. This
includes actions of a sexual nature, anything involving bodily fluids, and
the like.
In “Genetic Flaws,” for examp le, I tell about my visit to a semen-
collection facility for the purposes of genetic testing. I acknow ledge in the
story that I will need to masturbate in order to provide a sampl e, but at no
time am I specific about it in such a way to make an audience
uncomfortable. I use euphemisms, allusion, self-deprecation, and humor to
set the scene without exposing the scene. Everyone knows the reality of the
situation without needing to know the exact  reality of the situation.
In all stories, we take care of our audience by ensuring that they are not
repulsed, of fended, or disgusted by what we are saying.
A friend  once told a story at a Moth StorySLAM about his intestinal
disagreement with Thai food while on a first date. While sitting on the
woman’ s white couch, my frien d experiences a loss of bodily control, and
the result is an unfortunate situation for both him and the couch. He
described the defiling of the cushions in specific, graphic detail, including
color , smell, viscosity , and texture. He scored poorly with the judges that
night, because his description of the situation was repulsive and sickening.
What he thought was honest and authentic was revolting.
All he needed to say was that he stood up, turned around, and
discovered a “situation” on the couch. “A serious situation. An unfortunate
situation.”
This would have resulted in both an understanding and a laugh while
not repulsing the audience in any way .
I once heard a storyteller talk about how he and his father would spend
hours in their basement watching pornography when he was a teenager .
This story was less graphic than my friend’ s couch defilement,  and yet the
story was still vulgar because of the level of creepiness and the ick factor . I
actually think this story could be told well with humor , self-deprecation,
some unexpected heart, and the heavy use of euphemisms, but this
storyteller opted for none of these, and the judges made him pay the price.
I once heard a storyteller describe sex with a woman as a Christmas
tree, with the presents underneat h the tree being worth the wait. He was not
graphic or overly specific, but it was creepy and objectifying, and therefore
vulgar .
The rule with vulgarity is simple: If you are speaking about a topic that
would be awkward to talk abou t with your parents or grandpa rents, tread
lightly . Take care of your audience.
Other People’s Names
I’m often asked how to handle using real people’ s names in my stories. I tell
storytellers that changing the names of people to protect their anonymity is
perfectly reason able. When you change the name, however , I always
suggest that you choose a similar name to make it easier to remember .
Barry becomes Bobby .
Sally becomes Sandy .
As a teacher , I always wait five years before telling a story involving a
student. Even then, I always change the student’ s name, and I never tell
stories about students that cast them in a negative light. They are always
stories about my failures as a teacher . Never the failures of my students.
Sometimes we just don’t tell certain stories. Speaking them aloud might
irreparably damage relationships with loved ones. You may expose
someone else’s secret. You may put your job or your company in jeopardy .
Sometimes it’ s just not worth the story .
I once had a storyteller say to me, “You’re so lucky that your mom is
dead.” She quickly realized what she had said and backtra cked, but I
understood her meaning. My mom passed away , so I’m able to tell stories in
which she is less than heroic. I don’t have to worry about her getting angry
with me.
In truth, I’ve been talking about my parents’ failures for a long time.
There is very little that I don’t share with the world, but this is me. It might
not be you. I’m a big believer in the words of novelist Anne Lamott: “You
own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories. If people wanted
you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better .”
For this reason, I also name my former stepfather by both his first and
last name in my stories. I believe in naming the villains in our lives. Neil
McKenna destroyed my mother ’s life, and in many ways he seriously
damaged the lives of his stepchildren in the process. He was a despicable
human being, so I say his name with enthusiasm.
In the end, you make the choice over what names you want to use. Just
be sure to consider the possible long-term ef fects of using the name.
Celebrity / Pop Culture References
I once described a former girlfriend in a story as “the kind of girl Zooey
Deschanel plays in movies.” Then I watched about half the audience nod in
understanding and the other half squint in confusion.
That was the moment I stopped using celebrities as comparison s in my
stories.
When we refer to celebrities in our stories, we make three mistakes:
1.We risk alienating half of our audience, who might not be aware
of the reference. While one side of the room nods and laughs in
recognition, the other side of the room feels foolish or lost.
2.Comparing a person to a celebr ity sticks that celebrity into the
story and pops that mystical time-traveling bubble. I once heard
a storyteller say that her father looked a lot like Ronald Reagan.
As a result, Reagan was now playing the role of her father in the
story , and having a former presi dent walking around her cruddy
little apartment made no sense. It’s impossible for an audience to
picture someone looking “kind of like Ronald Reagan.” They
will just use Reagan, turning a formerly sensible story into
something dreamlike and strange. Just don’ t do it.
3.It’s lazy. We gain very little by saying “so-and-so looks or acts
like so-and-so.” It’s shorthand, but it doesn’ t reveal much about
character .
Instead of comparing my form er girlfriend to a Zooey Deschanel
character , I now say something like this:
Jen was the kind of girl who never seemed to have a job but always
seemed to have just enough money. She was carefree. The girl who
would never grow up. Never grow old. Never worry or complain.
She always had a new obsessio n, and each obsession was cooler
than the one befor e. She was ether eal but pr esent. Happy but aloof.
This description makes people nod, smile, and laugh. No one squints.
Accents
The rule on accents is simple:
Don’ t.
There is never a reason to imitate the accent of a person from  another
country or another culture. A white man imitating the accent of the Mexican
cabdriver (as I once heard a storyteller do) only runs the risk of making the
white man sound insensitive and racist (which it did).
There is one exception to this rule: you can always do the accents of
parents and grandparents. Parental love conquers the potential  hazards of
racial stereotypes.
I also think that you can imitate the accents from the region where you
grew up, particularly if you share a race with the people who you are
imitating. For example, I grew  up near Boston and had a Boston accent.
I’ve lost much of it after living in Connecticut for almost twenty-five years,
but I could reproduce the accent for a story if I wanted, and it occasionally
creeps into my speech.
I don’t think I would use it. I can’t see any reason to do so, and I think it
might be a distraction. But it wouldn’ t be objectionable, just as it wouldn’ t
be wrong for a person who grew up in Ireland but has lost the Irish accent
to imitate it when repeating dialogue from childhood.
But I would tread lightly here. Even if a blond, blue-eyed, white man
grew up in a Puerto Rican neighborhood with Puerto Rican friends,
imitating a Puerto Rican accent under these circumstances is fraught with
peril and should not be done.
When in doubt, don’ t do an accent.
STORY BREAK
The Weather Sucks. So Don’t Talk about It.
As I write this, it is snowing outside. Meteorologists are referring to the
storm as a blizzard. Much of Connecticut is shut down (though I’ve just
returned from a successful trip to Dunkin’ Donuts), and apparently the
grocery-store shelves are empty , but here’ s the thing:
Tomorrow , less than twenty-fou r hours from now, the storm will have
ended. The sun will shine high in the sky. The roads will be clear . And
though we may have a foot or two of snow on the ground, we have certainly
seen this much snow before in New England and will see this much snow
again. Probably more.
I despise the ongoing, never -ending, relentless conversations about the
snow , the impending snow , the snowfall projections, and the incessant
complaining about the snow . One of my primary goals in teaching
storytelling is to make the world a more interesting place. If people know
how to tell great stories and know the right stories to share, then the world
becomes a more entertaining, connected, and meaningful place to live. I
believe this with all my heart.
Conversations about the weather are the antithesis of this ideal of an
entertaining, connected, meaningful world. They are the death of good
conversation. They are the enemy of the interesting.
My humble suggestion: Avoid these conversations at all costs. Change
the subject. Do not engage. Walk away if necessary . You will be the
happier , and the more interesting, for it.
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Time to Perform (Onstage, in the
Boardroom, on a Date, or at the
Thanksgiving Table)
As I’ve said,  I’ve only been nervous while performing twice in my life.
Once was that time at a Moth Mainstage at Boston’ s Wilbur Theatre. It’s a
story I’ve told in chapter 9 .
The second time was in 2015, when I told “The Robbery” at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. I had told a version of the story the year
before at a Moth GrandSLAM, but I have no recollection of telling it. My
post-traumatic stress disorder is linked specifically to the events that took
place in that story, but after years of therapy , I was finally able to talk about
the robbery without breaking down.
It had become a scar instead of a wound. Or so I thought.
I took the stage that night, stepped up to the microphone, and took a
deep breath. The next thing I remember , I was walking off the stage and
back to my seat. I sat down beside Elysha, and she said, “What happened?”
Though I told a coherent versio n of the story , and I had actuall y scored
well (finishing in second place), it was not the version of the story that I
intended to tell. I was angry , defiant, and emotional. I left out some of the
more reflective parts of the story and included parts that I had intended to
leave on the cutting-room floor . The sound engineer that night, Paul Ruest,
later said to me, “I’ve never heard you get so upset onstage.”
I have no recol lection of the performance. It’s a perfect hole in my
memory .
My therapist later explained to me that I had not mentally prepared
myself to tell that story to a large audience. “There’ s a big difference
between telling the story to me or Elysha and telling the story to hundreds
of strangers. Y ou can do it, but you need to be prepared.”
A year later, I was ready to tell it again, this time in a Moth Mainstage
in front of an audience of almost a thousand people. But for the second time
in my life, I was nervous. I didn’ t want to black out again.
I also wanted to do well. Cather ine Burns, The Moth’ s artistic director ,
the director of my story , and the human being whose opinions on stories I
value the most, would be sitting in the front row. For the second time in my
life, those damn butterflies began fluttering around.
Catherine was nervous that night too. She was directing anoth er story
and was worried about the storyteller . He was performing for the first time,
and she wanted him to do well.
During our mic check, I started to wonder if Catherine was worried
about me too. I thought she had confidence in me, but now I wasn’t so sure.
About half an hour before show time, I finally asked, “Do you ever get this
nervous about me?”
“No,” she said. “You could certainly mess up your story , but you never
stop talking, so I know you’ll eventually find your way back.”
That was the second and last time I was nervous taking the stage to
perform. Catherine’ s words meant the world to me, not only because of the
confidence they conveyed, but because she was right. As long as a
storyteller keeps telling a story , all is well.
I’ve seen people stop speaking onstage. Typically these are storytellers
who have memorized their stories word-for -word, and at some point,
they’ve forgotte n a word. I’ve seen moments of silence last a minute or
more. They feel like forever .
Part of it is nervousness too. When your mind is frayed and frazzled
because you are afraid (which is what nervousness really is), it’s hard to
perform at your best.
This does not mean that nervousness is always a bad thing. Back in
2012, I stepped off the stage at The Bell House and was met by Steve
Zimmer , who, as I’ve said, is one of the best storytellers in the world. I had
been admiring Steve from afar for a while, mesmerized by his craft. He has
beaten me two or three times already and deservedly so. He was (and is) my
storytelling hero.
Steve stopped me as I walked back to my seat and said, “You know
what your problem is?”
I had never spoken to my hero before, so I was flummoxed. “No?” I
managed.
“You’re not nervous up there, so you have to have a great story every
time.”
Steve said other things to me that night. Kind and generous  things.
Things that made me feel as if I was on top of the world. Today I’m proud
to call him my friend.
But that night in The Bell House , I knew almost instantly that Steve was
right. When Steve performs, he is nervous. Backstage, he paces and
mumbles to himself. Onstage, he is jittery and uncertain for the first few
moments of his story , despite his honest-to-goodness greatness.
His nervousness serves him well. Audiences love Steve before he even
says a word. Every person in an audience wants to be on the stage to some
degree. Maybe it’s less than 1 percent of their being that wants to perform,
and maybe it’s 99 percent. Whatever the percentage, Steve connects with
the audience before he even speaks, because through his nervousness, he
shows them that he is just like them.
They are rooting for him before he ever says a word.
I stand there like a jerk. I’m not worried at all. If the audience doesn’ t
like me, I act as if it’s their own damn fault. Steve is right. I had better tell a
great story, because I give the audience nothing to love as I stand before
them. I’m an overly confident, probably arrogant, “neckless stump with legs
for arms,” in the words of one friend.
The lesson here: Nervousness can be your friend. Too much of it is
never good, but not being nervous at all isn’t good either . I bristle at the
saying, “If you’re not nervous, you don’t care enough,” becaus e I couldn’ t
care more about performing well, but there is some truth in this statement. It
ain’t always bad to be nervous.
Elysha is nervou s before every show she hosts, and during the first few
minutes onstage , her hands have been known to shake. She eventually eases
into confidence as the show proceeds, but initially , she is visibly anxious.
The audience loves her for it. They love her courage. Her authenticity .
The way that she is just like them, just as nervous as they might be if they
were hosting the show .
There are moments, of course, when nervousness won’ t help you. If you
are presenting at a professional conference, pitching or selling a product,
delivering the State of the Unio n address, or teaching high-school seniors,
nervousness will not be perceived well. When you are supposed to be the
expert or the authority , confidence is often required.
But performing onstage? Talking to a girl on a first date? Delivering a
wedding toast? Even a job interview? A little bit of nervousness is fine.
Helpful, even. It’s endearing. It shows how much you care. It bridges the
gap between you and your audience.
I was recently asked why I am not nervous onstage. I used to say that
twenty years working as a wedding DJ equipped me to speak
extemporaneously to lar ge groups of people without being nervous.
But then Bengi, my DJ partne r, reminded me that I wasn’ t nervous
when I started working as a DJ. I was supremely confident from  the get-go,
even though we had no idea of what we were doing.
So I told the woman who asked that I wasn’ t sure why I’m not nervous.
“Maybe it’s just in my DNA. Maybe I’m just a confident jerk.” Then
another woman  who had spent the week learning storytelling from me
raised her hand.  She said, “I just think you’re not afraid because speaking
onstage can never be as bad as all the stuf f you’ve been through.”
She might be right. When you’ve been brought back to life by CPR
twice, been arrested and tried for a crime you didn’ t commit, been
homeless, and suffered through a brutal robbery and decades of PTSD, the
stage doesn’ t seem so bad.
I started this book assuring you that you needn’ t die or spend time in jail
or get pulled from a burning building to be a great storyteller , and it’s true.
Absolutely true. But perhaps reminding yourself of the adversity that
you’ve overcome in your own life will help with your nerves. Maybe it’ll
give you a little bit of confidence onstage.
Maybe it’ll give you too much  confidence onstage. So much so that
your storytelling hero sees it as a problem.
Regardless, don’t avoid telling stories because you’re nervous. Embrace
your nerves. Allow them to serve you well.
When it’s time to perform, here are some other hints to help you do
well, whether you’re telling a story at your uncle’ s funeral, your mother ’s
fifth wedding, your high-school graduation, your dream job interview , or
The Moth.
Don’ t memorize your story .
Actors are requi red to memorize their lines. You are not, nor should you.
Actors also have fellow actors on the stage or in the wings to help them
when they for get a line. Actors are also pretending to be other people.
It’s hard to be authentic and vulnerable when you’re reciting lines. It’s
also obvious to an audience when a storyteller is simply reciting a story
instead of telling a story .
Instead of memorizing your story word-for -word, memorize three parts
to a story:
1.The first few sentences. Always start strong.
2.The last few sentences. Always end strong.
3.The scenes of your story .
If you’re following my advice and placing every moment of your story
in a physical location (chapter 11), then your story will be composed of
scenes: places where the action, dialogue, and internal monologues are
taking place. If you remember these places, you will remember what
happens there, even if every prepared word of your story suddenly flees
your mind. In “This Is Going to Suck,” for example, my scenes are:
1.On the sidewalk outside the record store
2.Driving in my car through Mendon, Massachusetts
3.The accident scene immediately following the collision
4.The ambulance
5.The emer gency room
6.The waiting room outside the emer gency room
7.The other side of the emer gency room
I don’t memorize my stories. I memorize the places where my story
takes me, so even if I can’t reme mber how I want to tell it, I can still do so.
I may lose some laugh lines, clever transitions, and “golden sentences,” but
I’m still telling my story . It may not sound as good as it could, but I’m not
trapping my audience in awkward, story-killing silence.
As Catherine said, I just keep talking.
Some people remember their scenes in a list, but I actually remember
these scenes as circles in my mind. The size of the circle reflects the size of
the scene. The color of the circle reflects the tone and tenor of the scene.
This is not something I do purposefully . It’s just the way I have always
remembered my stories. I tell you this because for some people, this method
has been exceptionally helpful.
I try not to have more than seven scenes in a story . The phone company
uses seven digits in our phone numbers because they determine d that seven
bits of informat ion is the most that the average person can retain at one
time. Seven feels right to me. I have some stories that only have three
scenes — even better . I have a story composed of just one scene . But seven
is my max.
Make eye contact.
There are many times when I am standing onstage and I can’t see a thing. A
spotlight is shining in my eyes, and I am enveloped in a curtain of black. In
those cases, eye contact is impossible.
But when you can see your audience — in a classroom, a conference
room, your aunt’s kitchen, a reception hall, or a faculty meeting — eye
contact is important. Y ou can’ t speak to the middle distance and expect your
audience to connect.
That said, you also need not make eye contact with each and every
person. Y ou have enough to do without inventorying your audience.
My suggestion is this: Find a person on your left, a person on your right,
and a person dead center who likes you. These will be the people who are
smiling. Noddin g. Laughing. Use these three people as your guideposts.
Make eye contac t with them, and the people in each of those areas will feel
you are attending to them as well.
Choosing people who like you will make you feel great.
Control your emotions.
There are mom ents in a story when you may become emotio nal. This is
perfectly reason able. We talk about the moments of our lives that mean the
most to us. Naturally , some of them will be emotionally char ged.
I become emotional during “This Is Going to Suck” when I say that my
friends have filled the waiting room outside the emer gency room. Part of
the reason for this is that I see my story in my mind’ s eye. When I say that
the emer gency room doors open, I see them open as I tell my story . I see my
story . I relive my story .
Not everyone can do this, but those who can often run the greatest risk
of becoming emotional as they perform. To prevent myself from becoming
too emotional in these moments, I’ve developed a trick. A strategy to get
some distance from my story .
When I was a kid, I played video games in arcades. One of these games
was a car-racing  game. I would sit behind the wheel and race against other
players behind other wheels. The game had an A and a B button to the left
of the gearshift. If you pressed the A button, the screen displayed the road
as a driver woul d see it through the windshield. If you pressed the B button,
your perspective shifted to outside and above the car , looking down upon it.
As the moment of heightened emotion approaches in a story , I press the
B button . I shift my perspective  from seeing my story through my eyes to
seeing my story from above. Rather than watching my friends appear in that
doorway , I watch a wounded boy see his friends standing in that doorway . I
am still emotional in that moment, but not nearly as emotional as I would be
if I relived the experience through my own eyes.
It takes some practice to be able to alter perspectives in this way, but it
can be helpful in stories when a little emotion is perfectly fine but weeping
is not.
You can also inoculate yourself against the power of certain sentences
by saying them over and over again before performing. By turning
meaningful moments into repetitive sentences, you can sometimes strip
some of the emotion from them . Often an audience’ s presence will inject
some (or all) of the emotion right back into the sentence, but usually to a
lesser degree, making the moment more manageable.
There’ s also nothing wrong  with becoming emotional during
storytelling as long as your emotion doesn’ t overwhelm your craft. My wife
was emotional during our entire wedding ceremony , but she was still able to
recite vows, laugh, and enjoy the moment. She was endearing,  sweet, and
authentic. Beautiful too.
You should aim to do the same.
Learn to use the microphone.
Learn to use a microphone from someone who uses a microphone
professionally . I could discuss proper microphone use here, but there are
many kinds of microphones, and it’s the kind of thing learned best while
doing it.
Most people use microphones poorly . Don’ t be that person. The audio
engineer at The Moth once complimented me on my microphone use. “You
can cut right through the laughter when you want,” he said. “That’ s so
great.”
It is. When I can cut through laughter or applause and return to my
story , I control the pacing of the performance. I dictate how the story will
be told.
I learned how to use a micropho ne effectively by working as a wedding
DJ for two decades. Just try to guide a bride through a bouque t toss while
music plays, single girls scream , and photographers call out for the ideal
pose.
You learn quickly about how to cut through the noise with your voice.
You think you know how to use a microphone, but you probab ly don’t.
Find an expert and practice.
That said, here are three universal tips that apply to almost all
microphone situations:
1.The microphone is not a magic al device. Many people believe
that once they are speaking into a microphone, they can speak as
softly as they want. It’s not true. Even when you’re speaking
into a micropho ne, you should be trying to speak to the back of
the room. Think of the microp hone as the guarantee that your
voice will reach the back of the room, but you must do the work
first. Y ou must push your voice through the device.
2.If you’re speaking into a microphone set on a stand, be sure that
the microphone is perfectly adjusted before you speak. Don’ t
rush this process. Every second that it takes you to adjust the
microphone will feel like ten minutes, but to the audience, it will
feel like less than a second. Take your time. There is nothing
worse for you or the audience to be thinking about a poorly set
microphone as you speak.
3.If given the option to use a microphone, do so regardless of how
booming your voice may be. In speaking to hundreds of
audiences, I have learned that hearing impairment is far more
prevalent than most people realize, and quite often hearing-
impaired people have no desire to announce their impairment to
the world. I simply assume that there is a hearing-impaired
person in every audience, so if asked if I want to use a
microphone, I always say yes.
STORY BREAK
The Solitude of the Storyteller
I’m standing onstage at the Music Hall of Williamsbur g in Brooklyn.
Storytellers are taking turns sound-checking for tonight’ s Moth
GrandSLAM.
One of the story tellers finishes her mic check and moves to the rear of
the stage  beside me. “Wow,” she says. “This place is huge. That was scary .
Intimidating.” It’ s her first GrandSLAM. It’ s my sixteenth.
“Yeah,” I say. “And the thing about storytelling is that it’s not like
theater . You’re on your own out there. No one can help you. You stand
alone in your truth and hope that you don’t freeze or fail. The whole thing
rests on your shoulders.”
By the time I’m done speaking, the storyteller ’s jaw has droppe d open.
She looks terrified.
“Oh my God,” I say, realizing what I have just done. “It’s not like that at
all. Everyone performs brilliant ly here. You have nothing to worry about.
I’m an idiot.”
Only the last sentence is true.
Fortunately , the storyteller does well.
I win my fourth  GrandSLAM that night, but I’ll always wonder if that
storyteller thought I was messing with her head.
I wasn’ t. I really am an idiot.
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Why Did You Read This Book? To
Become a Superhero!
In his memoir  Tough Shit, filmmaker Kevin Smith writes that anytime a
person is speaking to a group of people, in any context, the speaker has a
duty and an obligation to be entertaining.
I couldn ’t agree  more. It’s the purpose of this book. Or at least one of
them.
Whether you are speaking to friends on barstools or studen ts in a
classroom or customers in a conference room or grandchildren at
Thanksgiving or an audience of thousands in a theater , you must be
entertaining.
I have attended thousands of meetings, training sessions, conferences
over my lifetime  where the person delivering the content made no effort to
engage the audience in an entertaining and memorable way .
I will never understand this. Not only do you have an obligation to be
entertaining, you have an opportunity  to be entertaining. You have the
chance to set yourself apart from the ever-present drone of the masses. You
have the opportunity to make people smile. Laugh. Engage. Learn. Feel
better about the time spent.
This is what I call the Spider -Man Principle of Meetings and
Presentations (though Voltaire admittedly said it first): “With great power
comes great responsibility .”
I like to think about storytelli ng in terms of superheroes, because I
believe that a person who can speak in an entertaining and engaging way to
a group of people possesses a superpower that is sorely lacking in the world
today . As people’ s gazes continue to fall to their screens and
communication is truncated into bite-size text messages, the human beings
who can still hold the attention of an audience and teach and speak in an
entertaining way possess enormous power .
In 2015 , I spent some time in Brazil consulting with an engineering
firm. The CEO of the company  told me that he would rather hire poorly
trained engineers who can speak to potential clients, meet with government
agencies, and pitch projects to large groups of people than highly skilled
engineers who lack these communication skills.
Why? “I can teach a bad engineer to be a good engineer . But I have no
idea how to turn a person who can’t write or speak well into someone who
can. I’m not sure if it’ s even possible.”
It’s possible; unfortunately , it takes longer than the afternoo n I was
spending with this man. But think about that: bad engineers who can speak
well will be hired over good engineers who cannot. That is a superpower .
Or think about it this way: If you are conducting a one-hour meeting at
your company , you have effectively stolen one hour from every person in
the room. If there are twenty people in the room, your presentation is now
the equivalent of a twenty-hour investment.
It is therefore your responsibili ty to ensure that you do not waste the
hour by reading  from PowerPoint slides, providing information  that could
have been delivered via email, lecturing, pontificating, pandering, or
otherwise boring your audience. You must entertain, engage, and inform.
Every single time.
But I also believe that there is a second, equally important reason to be
entertaining:
When you are entertaining, people learn better . You convey information
more effectively . You will become a better teacher , presenter , coach,
salesperson, trainer , CEO, professor , parent, and dinner companion.
Yes, dinner companion. If you are on a first date, your goal should be to
share information about yourself in an entertaining fashion.
This is who I am.
This is what I believe.
This is what I want.
This is what I dr eam.
How about you?
A first date is an interview of sorts. If you can make the person laugh, share
a little vulnerability , and tell a good story in the process, your chances for
second and third dates increase exponentially .
My wife married a neckless stump with legs for arms. It wasn’ t because
of the way I looked.
And yes, it will make you a better parent too. When I can teach my son
and daug hter a lesson using an entertaining story from my past, not only is
that lesson more effective and enduring, it’s often requested again and
again. Rather than nagging my children about something that I feel is
critical to their development, I find them demanding that I teach them the
lesson over and over again. That is a superpower .
When a student-teacher presents me with a lesson that he or she would
like to teach to my class, my first question is always this: “What’ s the hook?
What is the reason for my students to listen and pay attention to you?”
Far too often, inexperienced (and ineffective) teachers believe that if
they design a lesson using all of methods and strategies that they have
learned in college, their students  will sit quietly , attend fully, and absorb the
content.
For about half to two-thirds of an average class of students, this will
probably be the case. But for the rest, effective lesson design is never
enough. These are the studen ts who slip through the cracks in many
classrooms. They are the kids who have ability and potential but lack the
necessary skills to learn. They are the children who are not predisposed to
quiet, thoughtful attentiveness. They are the kids who can barely sit still.
The ones with one foot still on the baseball diamond and one finger still on
the video-game  controller . They are the students who do not believe in
themselves or their capacity for a bright future. They are kids who come to
school hungry and tired and still reeling from the chaos and violence of an
evening at home.
These are the students who need a reason to listen.
I believ e that it is the teacher ’s responsibility to provide a reason to
learn. A meaningful, entertaining, engaging, thrilling, fly-by- the-seat-of-
their-pants reason to keep their eyes and ears and minds open.
This is why every lesson require s a hook. A hook is not a statement like
“This material will be on Friday’ s test” or “This is something you’ll use for
the rest of your life.” A hook is an attempt to be entertaining , engaging,
thought-provoking, surprising, challenging, daring, and even shocking. This
can be done in dozens, and perhaps hundreds, of ways.
A teacher can be funny . Surprising. Animated. Confused. Even
purposefully depressed. A teach er can offer students uncommon levels of
choice or challenge them with a meaningful, winner -take-all competition. A
lesson can include something students have never seen before or (even
better) something they have seen a thousand times before, but now in an
entirely new context. The lesson can include cooperative learning in groups
that the children will actually enjoy. Students can be made the center of the
lesson. Students can be invited to teach the lesson. Lessons can be broken
up into smaller , rapidly changing segments to hold student interest.
This is just a smidgen of the strategies that teachers can use, and most if
not all of them can also be used by a person running a meeting, conducting
a workshop, or otherwise steali ng an hour from people in order to convey
content.
Most importantly , a teacher can use storytelling. Not only is storytelling
an entertaining way to engage and entertain students, but it opens your heart
to your students . It demonstrates your humanity , your authenticity , and your
vulnerability . It’s a way to establish trust and faith with your students. It
connects you to them.
When your students love you, they will learn, even if they despise the
subject.
This is how I approach teaching  every day. I believe with all my heart
that I am stealin g seven hours of childhood from each of my students on a
daily basis. I am paid to be a thief. I rob my students of hour upon hour of
the most precious and fleeting time of their lives. Therefore I have a duty to
make this time as meaningful, productive, memorable, and yes, entertaining
as possible.
I do this through storytelling.
I do the same thing when delivering a TED Talk. Speaking at a
conference. Sharing a story at Passover dinner . Telling my kids a story
while driving the car. Sharing a memory on the golf course. I entertain and
engage and inform through storytelling. I open my heart and allow my
audience to step inside.
Here is someth ing crazy . Perhaps the craziest thing that has ever
happened to me through storytelling:
Four times  I have stepped off the stage at a storytelling show and been
approached by a woman who wanted to share the story of her miscarriage
with me.
Four times.
In all four instances, the woman’ s miscarriage was a secret. She had told
no one that she was pregnant, and no one knew that she had miscarried. She
told me first.
I was speechless the first time this happened. I called Elysha
immediately after the show to tell her .
Elysha’ s response was surprising. “Of course she wanted to tell you,”
she said. “You stood on that stage and talked about one of your most
difficult moments in your life with complete honesty . Your story made you
safe to talk to. And she never needs to see you again. She could unburden
herself of this secret to someone  she knew she could trust, and she doesn’ t
have to see you at work or home the next day .” It made sense.
It’s why I tell the story of my homelessness to my students, and an hour
later a girl tells me about living in a car with her mom over the summer .
It’s why I tell the story of spend ing a day in jail, and the next day a boy
tells me that his father is in prison.
It’s why my friend Jeff accidentally told me the sex of both of his
children prior to their birth. I told him a story on the golf course, and
finding a safe and vulnerable space, he filled it with a secret he was
carrying. Accidentally . Twice.
Back in 2011, Elysha suffered a miscarriage, and I watched her navigate
the complex landscape of emotions surrounding this loss. Grief. Shame.
Anger . Blame. Miscarriages are not often spoken about openly in our
culture, so women find themselves dealing with this tragic loss quietly .
Of course it makes sense that these women shared their stories with me.
Elysha had me to talk to when  she miscarried, and I had Elysha, but not
everyone is so fortunate. Not everyone is blessed with close, trusting
friendships, understanding family members, or loving partners.
These women didn’t tell me about their miscarriages because of who I
am. They told me about their miscarriages because I told them a story . A
story filled with heart and humor. A story that expressed authenticity ,
vulnerability , and truth.
This should be our goal.
The world is filled with uninteresting people. I meet them every day. I
suspect that in most cases, there is an interesting person lurking beneath
their unfortunately uninteresting veneer .
These are people who answer , “How was your day?” with an itinerary
of the day instea d of sharing a meaningful moment. They are folks who tell
us about their vacations by offering an adjective-laden time line of the
week. They are the people who make meetings feel endless, dinners feel
monotonous, and conferences feel disappointing.
These are the people who are afraid to talk about embarrassing moments
or epic failures.  They lack authenticity . Listen poorly . Fear vulnerability .
Lack the skills and strategy to craft and tell a good story . They are not the
superheroes of our world.
Storytellers have a superpower . They can make people feel good and
whole and right. They can inspire and inform. They can make people see
the world in a new way . They can make people feel better about themselves.
I may not be able to stop a bullet, but I make a woman feel better about
a tragic loss. I can convince a reluctant teen to learn. I can make an
audience laugh and cry in the span of a single story . I can make my children
beg for more. I can make an eight-hour training session feel like two hours.
I can convince a woman of absolute grace and beauty to marry me.
Me.
Fuck Superman. I’ll take storytelling any day .
I offer this superpower to you. This book is the instruction manual. All
you need now is to practice. Begin collecting stories and telling stories.
Become the storyteller I know you can be.
Acknowledgments
I would not be standing on stages  or telling stories, nor would I be
teaching storytelling around the world or writing this book, if not for The
Moth. This remarkable organization, founded by Geor ge Dawes  Green, has
provided me with the platfo rm, the support, the guidance, and the
community that have made all this possible. Geor ge’s brilliant vision has
changed my life and the lives of many storytellers. I am forever indebted to
this remarkable group of people, who love stories at least as much as I do.
Special thanks as well to:
Elysha Dicks, my wife, who bought my first ticket to The Moth and
launched this unbelievable, unexpected, joyous journey into storytelling.
She has supporte d me every step of the way, and later, when it came time to
launch Speak Up, she joined me side by side on the journey . There is no
better partner for stories or for life. I tell my stories first for her and then for
everyone else.
Catherine Burns, artistic director of The Moth, who made me feel like a
storyteller of value and merit. She gave me confidence, suppo rt, and love
when I needed it most. Our long conversations about the nature of
storytelling have helped guide many of the lessons in this book.
Geor ge Dawes Green, who built the stage where I began this journey
and has been kind enough to offer support, expertise, and encouragement.
One of my first thoughts when I am crafting a story is, “Will Geor ge like
this?”
Jenifer Hixon, senior producer of The Moth, who has helped to find and
shape so many of my stories. Her words of wisdom are woven  throughout
this book.
Dan Kennedy , whose voice I first heard while listening to his book Rock
On: An Office Power Ballad . Years later, I would listen to him host The
Moth Podcast  and dream of the day when I might tell a story as well as he
does. He remains an inspiration to me, and I am proud to call him my
friend.
Throughout the writing of this book, I had many readers who followed
along chapter by chapter , and to each one of these people, I cannot express
the appreciation that I feel for all of your support. I’ve always been an
instant-gratification type of guy, and writing can be anything but this.
Knowing that you were out there, ready to read the next chapter just hours
after it was finished, made all the dif ference for me.
A few people of note:
C. Flanagan-Flynn, reader , story teller , writer , and editor extraordinaire.
A writer’s dream is to find an editor and friend who simultaneously adores
your work while spotting all the glaring holes in it. C has been that person
for me throughout this project.
Matthew Shepard, the reader who seems to share my brain (and name).
I could always depend upon Shep to notice an amusing play on words or a
vague and nearly indiscernible reference that other readers might miss.
Many a time I would write a sentence, smile, and think, “No one else will
notice this, but Shep will love it.” Rarely was I wrong. His comments,
critique, and suggestions shaped the book into what it has become. The
world will be a more interesting  place when Shep picks up a pen and begins
writing himself.
Jeni Bonaldo and her sister , Amy Miller , for their insight and
enthusiasm for this book and for storytelling. Having friends who are both
English teachers and storytellers is pretty fantastic.
The fans and supporters of my storytelling career , including and
especially our loyal Speak Up following. Month after month they have been
generous enough to listen to my stories and offer their support. Every
storyteller needs an audience, and I can’ t imagine a better one.
All of the storytellers who have spent time in my workshops over the
years. This book was born from those thousands of hours spent teaching
this craft to brave, enthusiastic students. I have learned so much from these
people and owe an enormous debt to each and every one.
Geor gia Hughes, editor extraord inaire, who believed in this book before
I entirely  believe d in it myself. A writer steps into the wilderness with some
dry twigs, a few branches, and fragile hope and must find a hero to spark
the fire. Geor gia was my heroic fire starter . I will be forever grateful.
Richard Smoley , the copy editor of this book, who saved me from many ,
many literary embarrassments. And Tanya Fox, proofreader , who not only
saved me from many literary and typographical gaffes but also offered me
several outstanding lessons in grammar and the correct name of the Canada
goose.
Taryn Fagerness, known officially as my literary agent, but a person
whom I think of as my friend in words. She has been my hero, my guiding
force, and in many ways, my partner . She has made my dreams come true.
She is my superhero.
